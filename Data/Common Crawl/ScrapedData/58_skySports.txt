"i sat down with my family, and my agent, and we went over it. the opportunity i've had here is amazing, i don't take that for granted. i work hard to get better every day and want to get blackburn back in the premier league."i'd played a lot of games for someone so young and didn't want to be sitting around making the squad now and then. i wanted to be playing week-in, week-out and that's what i'm doing now."the pace of the game is different in the championship to league one. people are a lot stronger and quicker, and tactically advanced. but my run this month is just one of those things. i've been creating chances since we got promoted, but i've not been as clinical as i have been recently."that's certainly an opinion shared by mowbray. two goals and four assists in the league in january - coupled with an fa cup strike against his boyhood club even armstrong admits was a little sweet - have seen him "come to the party", according to his manager.he can show the north east what its missing when he features at the riverside on sunday, but armstrong is too focused to let it bother him."i don't really look for any of the fixtures close to home when they come out," he admitted. "but it'll be nice to be back, to get home and see some family."                    predict 6 correct scores for your chance to win â£250k.
