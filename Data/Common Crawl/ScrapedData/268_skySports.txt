"four times in 15 years, that is an unbelievable achievement. i said to them before the game, 'it will not be pretty today - it will not be free-flowing'."off the ball we knew wimbledon would make it really difficult for us and they did. if we had got the second goal with 20 or 30 minutes to go we may have gone and got three or four and made it more comfortable."no disrespect to doncaster rovers, but if palace get through i want to get them [in the draw]. to be at the den, 20,000 of our fans to see a cup quarter-final is what i want."afc wimbledon manager wally downes was rueful about the early chance squandered just before wallace's goal, when joe pigott's glancing effort from a shane mcloughlin cross rattled off the post.he said: "if you're playing a team in the division above and you create a chance early, you've got to take it because you know they're going to be very efficient at what they do."if they get a chance, they're going to punish you and that's exactly what happened."                    predict 6 correct scores for your chance to win â£250k.
