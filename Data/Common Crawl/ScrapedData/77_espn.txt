kiper's mock 1.0 | mcshay's mock 2.0
big board | top 32 | draft ordernick bosa, de, ohio stateno change at the top here -- bosa is the top prospect in this class. he can be an elite pass-rusher at the next level, just like his brother joey. his workouts at the combine will be closely watched to see if he's back at full strength after his core muscle injury. as far as the fit in a 3-4 defense in arizona, this quote last week from new defensive coordinator vance joseph stood out: "4-3 college ends, they grow to be outside 'backers. it's a learned ability." joseph's former team in denver used a top-five pick on bradley chubb last year, and joseph converted him to outside linebacker -- opposite von miller --  and he had 12 sacks as a rookie. the 6-foot-4, 263-pound bosa would have a good edge-rushing partner in chandler jones.kiper, mcshay and sprow dissect the draft.
