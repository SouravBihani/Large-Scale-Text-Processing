"there are other examples of sexism in sport whether it comes down to prize money, the way male players are treated in comparison to women," she said."i think that is a bigger issue than what actually happened on saturday night in that us open final. i don't think that was the best example of sexism in sport in tennis."billie jean king defended williams, saying women are seen as "hysterical" when emotional while men are seen as "outspoken", but keothavong insists ramos, who received the backing of the international tennis federation on monday, was "doing his job".keothavong said: "yes, that is a valid point and i think sexism in tennis and across sport is also a valid point. it exists, let's not beat around the bush about it."but in this particular case, carlos ramos was doing his job. he is a strong umpire, respected by a lot of players, coaches and other umpires."he is a guy that all the other umpires look up to because he is strong, consistently strong."whether he is umpiring a men's match or a women's match, i think he treats [the players] as individuals equally. it has sparked an interesting debate."the former british no 1 is disappointed the fall-out of the match has taken away from osaka's performance."whoever watched that match that night, you feel for naomi osaka. she is going for her first grand slam title, grew up in new york, that was her moment," she added."she worked so hard for it her whole life. she has been dedicated to tennis - she deserved her moment and unfortunately she didn't get it and everything has been overshadowed by serena's behaviour."keothavong believes the way tennis players have reacted to the match has been "really noticeable"."it is interesting on social media everyone has come out in support of naomi osaka and what a great achievement it is - [her] first grand slam title," she said."a lot of players are happy for her. let's not forget the type of tennis she played that night. she played incredible tennis; regardless of how serena behaved, maybe naomi osaka would have won that match anyway."there has been a lot of support there but it has been interesting on social media anyway that not many players have spoken in support of serena. that for me has been really noticeable."                    the 2018 us open will be remembered as one of the most dramatic grand slam tournaments in history.
