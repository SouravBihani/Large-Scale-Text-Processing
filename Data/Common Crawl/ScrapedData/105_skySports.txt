"i am not that shocked but i am a bit shocked. it's a bit upsetting and frustrating. i feel like it's a bit unjust on me and my son."sky sources earlier revealed the teenager could have her uk citizenship revoked because it is believed she is a dual british-bangladeshi national.but the latest comments come after the lawyer representing her family said the uk-born teenager of bangladeshi heritage has never had a bangladeshi passport and is not a dual citizen.solicitor tasnime akunjee said shamima begum's family were "very disappointed" after the home office made an order "depriving shamima of her citizenship"."we are considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision," he said.shamima begum has spoken of how she wants to come back to britain after fleeing her london home to wed an is fighter in syria aged 15.she gave birth this week in a syrian refugee camp.in a letter obtained by itv news, the home office said an order "removing her british citizenship" had been made.the letter, addressed to shamima begum's mother, says: "if you are in contact with your daughter, or are able to establish contact with her shortly, i would be very grateful if you could ensure the home secretary's decision is brought to her attention, along with her right to appeal to the special immigration appeals commission, that arises as a result of the service and notice of intention to deprive her."after reading the letter for the first time, she told the news channel: "it's kind of heartbreaking to read. my family made it sound like it would be a lot easier for me to come back to the uk when i was speaking to them in baghuz. it's kind of hard to swallow."there are various criteria that have to be met if she is to be prevented from returning to the uk.she referred to others returning to the uk and said she did not know "why my case is any different to other people"."is it just because i was on the news four years ago?" she asked as she said she may look at potentially gaining citizenship through her dutch husband."another option i might try with my family is my husband is from holland and he has family in holland," she said."maybe i can ask for citizenship in holland. if he gets sent back to prison in holland i can just wait for him while he is in prison."addressing the issue in parliament, theresa may said any british citizen returning to the uk from syria "must be in no doubt they'll be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted".she added: "decisions on how people will be dealt with - they're taken on a case-by-case basis to make sure the most appropriate action is taken."and, of course, what we are doing is ensuring in every decision is that we put the protection of the public and the safety of the public first."the home office said it did not comment on individual cases but "any decisions to deprive individuals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly"."in recent days the home secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of britain and the people who live here," a spokesman said."in order to protect this country, he has the power to deprive someone of their british citizenship where it would not render them stateless."home secretary sajid javid has previously said shamima begum will "face consequences" for backing is.addressing the commons on monday, he revealed more than 100 people who had travelled to join is have been barred from entering britain due to their status as foreigners, or by having their british citizenship stripped if they are dual nationals.but, he highlighted how international law does not allow the uk to remove citizenship from those who are only british nationals.yet, mr javid vowed that "where individuals do manage to return, they will be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted".in an interview with sky news, shamima begum said "a lot of people should have sympathy" for her as she spoke of her wish to return to the uk.she also said the uk authorities had no evidence of her "doing anything dangerous", in response to concerns she could pose a security threat.in the interview with sky correspondent john sparks, she claimed she was "just a housewife" during her four years in the terrorist caliphate in syria, where she married a young dutch is fighter called yago riedijk three weeks after she arrived in the country in 2015.while she was aware of beheadings and executions being carried out by the extremists she said she was "okay with it", because she had heard "islamically that is allowed".shamima begum also told the bbc the manchester arena terror attack was "kind of retaliation" for bombings in syria.under the 1981 british nationality act, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied that it would be "conducive to the public good" and they would not become stateless as a result.ms begum has previously said she travelled to syria with her sister's uk passport but it was taken from her when she crossed the border.
