"i know vards and he's a robust player. he's always fit and does not get many injuries. obviously you've got to respect his decision."he spoke with the manager and he felt that was the best thing for his career at this moment in time."we have got plenty of other good strikers like rashford. welbs came on and he's been doing fantastically well in training, so hopefully it gives them an opportunity now."england will be particularly eager to get back to winning ways when they welcome switzerland to the king power stadium in tuesday's friendly.they were afforded a hero's homecoming at wembley, in recognition of their run to the semi-finals of the world cup but - having lost in the last four to croatia and to belgium in the third-place play-off."we still feel confident, but we still feel like we are learning. you want to play against the best teams and the best players to learn from the experiences," henderson continued."it is very powerful to go out when the atmosphere is brilliant so we have to keep putting performances in to keep that spirit there. we have to keep working hard."there's still a long way to where we want to get to, but there are still positives to take even though we are disappointed with the final result."                    play sky sports fantasy football to win weekly and monthly prizes.
