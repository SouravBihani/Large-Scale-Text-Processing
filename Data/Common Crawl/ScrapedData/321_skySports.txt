that's mawson's fellow defender federico fernandez. indeed, defenders were the recipients of the majority of these chances - a reflection of the fact that more than two thirds of all chances created by sigurdsson were headers. fernandez got on the end of five corners without finding the net. in fact, only one of them was even on target.just because llorente, mawson and fernandez are capable of diverting an outswinging corner in the general direction of the goal - and 28 of these 38 chances were from right-wing corners - does not necessarily mean the numbers are transferable to another club. tellingly, only three of these corners actually resulted directly in swansea goals.of course, expertise from set plays is not a negative. the fact that swansea ranked in the top three in the premier league for both headed and set-piece goals was a huge factor in their survival. everton would surely look to put sigurdsson on corners and free-kicks in the expectation that he can help to boost their own numbers in this regard.moreover, the fact that this skill is such a big part of sigurdsson's game adds context to the question marks over his age relative to his price. while he could be on the cusp of a downturn in output at 28, his set-piece delivery is unlikely to suffer into this thirties. that will bring confidence that he will be a useful asset for the full length of his next contract.however, it is vital that everton appreciate what they would be getting for their £50m investment. while the headline numbers put sigurdsson in the top bracket of premier league creators alongside kevin de bruyne, christian eriksen, mesut ozil and david silva, the type and quality of the chances they supply for team-mates are actually very different.to illustrate the point further, there are 71 players who created more open-play chances than sigurdsson in the premier league last season. that included kevin mirallas and three other everton players. ross barkley created 54 such chances. sigurdsson managed only 25 - the same number that gareth barry and idrissa gueye produced in fewer games.even from set plays, it is uncertain how much of an impact that sigurdsson might have at everton given that barkley, mirallas and baines shared the team's set-piece duties last term, creating 51 opportunities in the process - only one fewer than sigurdsson. a quality player then, but one whose £50m signature comes with considerable caveats. buyer beware.
