                                    football expert                                            last updated: 10/09/16 10:33pmmark hughes' behaviour as he was sent to the stoke stands against tottenham was a major surprise, according to andy hinchcliffe.the stoke manager was dismissed to the stands following an altercation with the fourth official on 35 minutes in stoke's 4-0 defeat to tottenham, meaning stoke have now made their worst start to a league campaign in 30 years.sparks stared to fly on the touchline when marko arnautovic was booked for simulation and hinchcliffe thinks the reason behind hughes' reaction is a culmination of a frustrating start to the season coupled with decisions going against his team."i do tend to think the way referees have treated mark hughes' teams and the penalties given against his team have frustrated him - maybe it was a bit of that coming to the fore," said hinchcliffe."for an experienced manager to react that strongly to something which was fairly irrelevant. it was a major surprise."son heung-min opened the scoring in the first-half for spurs, before doubling their lead. from there tottenham were always in control as dele alli and harry kane added further goals.however, the balance of the game could have changed if taylor had deemed victor wanyama's challenge on giannelli imbula worthy of a second yellow card with the game at 1-0.only a foul was awarded and hinchcliffe thought the referee got the decision wrong. "i do think victor wanyama should have been sent off," he said. "if spurs go down to 10-men then it's a very different story."but they make the change to take wanyama off and move christian eriksen into that no.10 role. minutes later, it's 2-0 and tottenham are in full control of the game. wanyama not getting sent off is a major turning point in the game."
