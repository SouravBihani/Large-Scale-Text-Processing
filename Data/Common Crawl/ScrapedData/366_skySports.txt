"the hardest part of football is scoring goals so when they're doing that as freely as they are they've got every chance of promotion."christmas will test their character but they've put themselves in a great position."hinchcliffe, meanwhile, compared their dominance of the championship to that of manchester city in the premier league."it's only 19 games in so maybe it's a bit early to be talking [about automatic promotion], but from what i've seen so far they're perfectly equipped to get through the winter," he said. "so even when it gets tough and cold and the games come thick and fast i don't think you'll see wolves fall away, i think they'll actually get stronger."any team playing wolves home or away has to be at their absolute maximum and hope they're having a bit of an off day. you look at manchester city in the premier league and it's very much the case when you play them. i'm not saying wolves are as good as man city in the championship, but they know how to win a game. they can tough it out and grind a team down, or play flowing football."don't miss the sky bet championship clash between birmingham and wolves on monday night, live on sky sports football and sky sports main event from 7.30pm
