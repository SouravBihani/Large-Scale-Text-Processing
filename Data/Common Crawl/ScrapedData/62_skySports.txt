saturday 16 february 2019 17:37, uka former us cardinal has been expelled from the roman catholic priesthood after a vatican investigation found him guilty of sex abuse against children and adults.theodore mccarrick, the former archbishop of washington, is the most high-profile church figure to be dismissed in modern times.the vatican said mccarrick, 88, was also found guilty of solicitation, a crime where a priest uses the pretext of confession to commit an immoral act with a person - in this case sex.the allegations date back several decades and mccarrick now lives in seclusion in a kansas friary after he lost his title of cardinal in 2018 - the first in nearly 100 years.he has now been defrocked which means he can no longer call himself a priest or celebrate the sacraments, although he would be allowed to administer the last rights to a dying person.with the ruling, pope francis appears to be sending a signal that even those in the highest levels of the church will be held accountable.the decision, made by the vatican's congregation for the doctrine of the faith three days ago, was announced ahead of next week's meeting at the vatican between the heads of national catholic churches to discuss the global abuse crisis.mccarrick had appealed the decision, which was first made on 11 january, but it was upheld earlier this week and the pope has ruled that no further appeal would be allowed.one man claimed that as a boy, mccarrick, then a priest, touched his genitals during confession.several priests and ex-priests alleged mccarrick coerced them to sleep with him when they were adults studying for the priesthood.mccarrick has responded publicly to only one of the claims, saying he has "absolutely no recollection" of an alleged case of sexual abuse of a 16-year-old boy more than 50 years ago.one of his victims, james grein, has expressed relief that pope francis believed his accusations and said he took part in the church investigation "with profound sadness".mr grein, the son of a friend of mccarrick, said that while he cannot regain his childhood, "today i am happy that the pope believed me".he accused mccarrick of sexually abusing him for two decades from the age of 11, including during confession.he added he hoped mccarrick would no longer be able to use the power of "jesus' church to manipulate families and sexually abuse children".mr grein, who testified in december in new york before a vatican-appointed investigator, said "it's time for us to cleanse the church".
