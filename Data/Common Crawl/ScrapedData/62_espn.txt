the nba all-star game draft is back for 2019! the 10 starters for this year's game in charlotte were selected through a vote combination of 50 percent fans, 25 percent players and 25 percent basketball media. the two starters who received the most fan votes -- the lakers' lebron james and bucks' giannis antetokounmpo -- were named captains. the league's head coaches then selected the 14 reserves, while commissioner adam silver included dwyane wade and dirk nowitzki as special roster additions (you can draft either or both in this game!).it's up to the captains to select their teams, with no regard for conference affiliations. so step into the shoes of either lebron or giannis and draft against the other guy -- controlled by a computer that "thinks" like a traditional all-star captain. then we'll use fivethirtyeight's nba player ratings -- along with each player's elite skills and bonuses based on your coaching acumen -- to simulate the result of the all-star game and see which captain is the king of the queen city. and just like in real basketball, no two games will play out exactly the same -- so keep playing until you draft your way to all-star glory.
                                  the king stays the king. you came up with a clutch performance in the draft and put together a winning squad. now, can you do the same in free agency in july?

                                  there will be no team lebron dynasty in the all-star game, as your squad didn't quite measure up. the good news? you're still lebron james.

                                  that was as easy as eurostepping from half court to throw down an epic slam. your drafting skills are almost as freakishly good as giannis himself. now, have a smoothie to celebrate!

                                  even when he's in the west, lebron still manages to defeat the best player in the east. take solace in your loss, though, knowing you won't see lebron in the east playoffs this year.
