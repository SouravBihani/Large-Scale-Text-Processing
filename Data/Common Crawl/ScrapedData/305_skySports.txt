"ranieri has brought his great experience, his serenity, and an italian style that we have seen sometimes in matches," sala told l'equipe last season.their connection even saw sala linked with a january move to ranieri's fulham ahead of the current transfer window."people see the way he fights for every ball. that encourages his team-mates to do the same. he is a good example for everyone," ranieri said of sala last season.despite ranieri's departure from nantes at the end of the 2017/18 season, sala's impressive form continued, with only kylian mbappe, edinson cavani, nicolas pepe and neymar outscoring him in the current campaign to date.last october, sala became the first player to score a ligue 1 hat-trick for nantes since mamadou diallo's treble against fc sochaux-montbeliard in 2006 and he enjoyed a warm relationship with the club and its fanbase.the argentine scored his final goal for nantes in december's 3-2 win over marseille and he made his final appearance for the club on january 16, coming off the bench for the final 18 minutes of a 1-0 defeat by nimes.sala had stayed on for one more match to help out injury-hit nantes for that midweek trip to nimes before bidding a fond farewell to his coaches and team-mates on the following monday morning, tweeting a picture of his former colleagues with a heart emoji and fatefully "la ultima ciao" - the final goodbye.la ultima â¤ï¸ ciao @fcnantes ðð»ðð pic.twitter.com/sv1dnhbyyhbut sala was also excited to make his mark with his new club, joking 'a new sala' was coming to the premier league as he looked forward to the prospect of going head to head with the likes of liverpool's mohamed salah.he told the cardiff website: "i'm very happy to be here. it gives me great pleasure and i can't wait to start training, meet my new team-mates and get down to work.there is a new sala in town @premierleague ð very happy to sign here @cardiffcityfc !! i know the challenge is big but together we will make it ðimpatient to discover the league & the team #bluebirds pic.twitter.com/oinqupbpib"for me, it feels special [to be the club's record signing]. i have come here wanting to work and to help my team-mates and the club. i can't wait to get to work straight away and do everything i can."with the club battling to avoid relegation, boss warnock welcomed sala's committed approach to the game."i like him, he's a hard worker," warnock said after the transfer was confirmed. "he's not going to knock the walls down straight away, but we need strikers."the people we're looking at are types of players who will fit in with our squad. he is hard working, works his socks off for the team, doesn't catch the eye at times but is a manager's type of player."that work ethic took sala to the top of the game.but as a person, he was even more fondly thought of by those who knew him best at nantes.he was sad to leave behind his friends in the french city, and the tearful tributes which followed reflect his immense popularity.
