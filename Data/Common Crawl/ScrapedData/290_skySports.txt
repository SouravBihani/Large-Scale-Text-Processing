"i don't think blackwell's amateur background was that extensive and i really fancied john ryder to beat him back in may. i felt that ryder would be too big and strong for him. credit to nick though, he dug in and stopped him.tom doran"he's getting better with each fight and i'm relishing the opportunity to get in the ring with him - after i've dealt with rod smith of course."i've got the style to cruise the odd rounds with my boxing against smith - i haven't watched much of him. he's going to come at me all guns blazing, but from what i've heard he's not a massive puncher and my class will show and i'm confident i will outbox him."i believe that i had enough experience before i took a break from boxing for three years to go for a british title then. i didn't though and i feel better for it experience-wise now. i feel that i'm maturing in and out of the ring - they are all big fights now."blackwell defends his british crown against elliott matthews on november 14.
