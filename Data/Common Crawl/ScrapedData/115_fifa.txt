* â¢ clear separation between âpoliticalâ and management functions:* the fifa council (replacing the fifa executive committee) is responsible for setting the organisationâs overall strategic direction, while the general secretariat oversees the operational and commercial actions required to effectively execute that strategy. â¢ term limits for the fifa president, fifa council members and members of the audit and compliance committee and of the judicial bodies (max. 12 years). â¢ election of council members supervised by fifa and in accordance with fifaâs own electoral regulations; all candidates subject to *comprehensive eligibility and integrity checks *conducted by an independent fifa review committee. â¢ greater *recognition and promotion of women in football *with a minimum of one female representative elected as a council member per confederation; promotion of women as an explicit statutory objective of fifa to create a more diverse decision-making environment and culture. â¢ disclosure of individual compensation on an annual basis of the fifa president, all fifa council members, the secretary general and relevant chairpersons of independent standing and judicial committees. â¢ enhanced control of money flows. â¢ universal good governance principles for confederations and member associations. â¢ fifaâs commitment to human rights to be enshrined in the fifa statutes. â¢ new *football stakeholder committee *to ensure greater transparency and inclusion through broader stakeholder representation (including players, clubs and leagues). find out more aboutâ the chronology of the reforms process.we answer some of theâ faq about theâ statutory reforms.about fifa01 feb 2016about fifa01 feb 2016
