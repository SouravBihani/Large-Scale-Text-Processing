          got aspirations on being the next msdossary, tekkz, nicolas99fc or gorilla but not sure what to do next?we spoke to some of fifa 19’s biggest esport pros to give you a few pointers.“follow your dreams. you just have to believe in yourself and take the opportunities that you get. in fifa 17 i qualified for one tournament and that has just built me a path that i’m living off. stay at it, keep on working hard.”“it’s impossible to become a pro player over one or two days, it takes years. it takes so much work and they must go for it. it will come if they believe in it.”“if you really want to become a professional player you need to believe in yourself. you need to never give up, grow up and keep your head up.”“just train, play and don’t forget to have fun. sometimes it’s a bit frustrating but at the end of the day we all play this game because we like football and we like fifa.”“put in the work no matter what. it’s going to be hard at first. ask pros for matches, see where you are compared to them, then just keep on working on your game.”“use the things at your disposal on ultimate team; the likes of rivals and weekend league. if you test yourself against top tier players and keep practising, you are bound to increase your skill.”if anyone wants a game, let me know! obviously prefer to play a top 100/pro player, but i’ll play anyone!“you need to do everything to focus, eat well before you play, sleep well, it helps a lot.”“save video clips – that’s what i do if i have a really good game or a i have a terrible game – and watch them back. you just have to learn from your mistakes and not worry about losing.”“try, if you can, to watch your own games, because that’s a big part of growing as a player. you need to see where you’re messing up and where you can improve. once you do that, you can compete at the top level.”“getting signed is just about having the ability to qualify for these events. the moment you qualify it is pretty much guaranteed teams will come in and try to sign you, especially if you do well.”“put your name out there, get on social media in the scene, make your name known there and qualify for events. once you qualify that’s only the beginning but once you do that you should be alright.”“if you lose you can’t go on twitter and say bad things about someone, you have to be a professional if you want to be in an esports team. a lot of guys are watching what you say, little kids too, so you have to be a role model they can look up to. combine that with good performances and you’ve got a good chance.”“join the team that feels right at the time. trust your gut and then that will most likely be right for you.”“don’t be rushing. everyone has to find what suits and fits them the best. you might see a team that has the glamour, the fame or the money but having a good team behind you will make you do well.”on a serious note i just want to be a pro fifa player! hoping for a day where an esports team hits my dm's🙏fifa eworld cup19 feb 2019fifa eclub world cup17 feb 2019fifa eclub world cup14 feb 2019fifa eclub world cup13 feb 2019fifa eclub world cup11 feb 2019
