last updated: 25/09/15 2:54pmtyson fury vowed to retire wladimir klitschko on october 24 after turning up to their london press conference dressed as batman.the challenger staged an elaborate entrance, wrestling a masked 'joker' to the ground and dragging him away before returning in a three-piece suit to confront triple world heavyweight champion klitschko.fury said he was as confident of victory in their clash on october 24  as he was "of waking up in the morning" and asked the assembled media "is there anyone who doesn't think i'm going to send wlad into retirement?"the mancunian then took umbrage at being described as "a clown" by klitschko, removing his jacket and offering to fight the ukrainian there and then.fury's father john intervened and klitschko kept his cool, promising to "save" his opponent in a renewal of a theme he first warmed to in the build-up to his 2011 victory over an equally-outspoken david haye.the head-to-head photoshoot passed without further aggravation as the two men refrained from physical contact and exchanged words only towards the end of a long staring match.but fury had already ensured shots of the press conference would be beamed around the world as he hurled a series of insults at klitschko which included calling the wbo, wba and ibf title-holder "an army sergeant or a schoolteacher - not a fighting man" and accusing him of having "superhero powers in boring people to death."that particular slur did not deter klitschko from launching into a lengthy monologue during which he admitted fury had provided "the most exciting press conference" of his career.he added: "i have a lot of friends from the circus industry. it's very tough to make people laugh. if i call you a clown it's a compliment."further details regarding the sky sports box office event on october 24 will be announced in due course.you can book via your sky remote and onlineall the follow-up and news on tyson fury's successdates for our live fight nights on sky sportsnews and interviews with boxing's big nameslisten to the latest boxing news
