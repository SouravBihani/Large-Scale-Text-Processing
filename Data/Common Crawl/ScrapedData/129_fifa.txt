          following the report submitted by the fifa monitoring committee israel-palestine chaired by tokyo sexwale and after a thorough legal consultation process, the fifa council has agreed on a position with regard to the administration of football in the west bank territories.the fifa council takes note of the documents adopted by international governmental bodies concerning the relationship between israel and palestine – such as united nations security council resolution 2334, which comprises recommendations without sanctions – but has decided that it should not take any position on their contents.the fifa council acknowledges that the current situation is, for reasons that have nothing to do with football, characterised by an exceptional complexity and sensitivity and by certain de facto circumstances that can neither be ignored nor changed unilaterally by non-governmental organisations such as fifa. given that the final status of the west bank territories is the concern of the competent international public law authorities, the fifa council agrees that fifa, in line with the general principle established in its statutes, must remain neutral with regard to political matters.furthermore, it was agreed that any interference by fifa in the status quo of football in the relevant territories without the consent of the parties concerned might aggravate the situation of football not only in the territories in question, but also in the greater region affected – which would not be in the best interests of the game.therefore, the fifa council has decided to refrain from imposing any sanctions or other measures on either the israel fa or the palestinian fa, as well as from requesting any other fifa body to do so. the matter is declared closed and will not be the subject of any further discussion until the legal and/or de facto framework has changed.with that said, the fifa administration will continue to facilitate the movement of players, officials and football equipment in, out of, and within palestine — the aspect on which the fifa monitoring committee israel-palestine has covered the most ground and achieved a positive response.about fifa27 oct 2017
