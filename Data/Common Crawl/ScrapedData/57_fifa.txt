          fifa is extremely pleased to see hakeem al-araibi released from prison in thailand and allowed to travel back to his home in australia. this is the outcome we have worked for together with a broad coalition of human rights organisations, governments and the wider football community over the past two months. we would like to sincerely thank everyone who has contributed to this outcome and, in particular, the relevant public authorities for doing the right thing and bringing hakeem’s ordeal to an end. we wish hakeem a safe return to his family and hope he will be able to resume his footballing career soon.about fifa29 jan 2019about fifa09 jan 2019about fifa24 jan 2019
