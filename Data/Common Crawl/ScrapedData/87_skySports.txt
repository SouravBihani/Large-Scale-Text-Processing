"we played confusing football in the second half but in the first half i think we played well," he said."we need more aggression and more determination in the situations inside our own box and inside the opposition box. the difference was there."we need to be faster, mentally and materially. we need more movements without the ball. we need less individual actions."when you have spaces, of course you can do individual actions. but when the situation is like it is in the second half, you need to move the ball faster and more movements without the ball otherwise it is impossible to score."after being beaten 6-0 by manchester city in their previous fixture on english soil, pressure is mounting on the italian but he is insistent that he is not worried by the sack."no, i was really very worried when i was in league two in italy," he said. "i am not worried now."it is not my problem. my problem is to work with the players to improve in a few days and find more determination and aggression."and when asked whether the chelsea players are still with him, he added: "i think so. of course, i am not sure, but i think so."chelsea face malmo in the second leg of their europa league tie at stamford bridge on thursday before taking on city in the carabao cup final on sunday.                    predict 6 correct scores for your chance to win â£250k.
