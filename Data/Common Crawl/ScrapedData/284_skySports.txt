queensberry promotions / chris farinaamerican boxing legend ‘sugar’ shane mosley stands on the verge of sealing his uk debut on december 19 after confirming to wbn that he is in negotiations to face liam smith in manchester.mosley previously gave wbn an exclusive following some public twitter beef between the two and says contact was made about the pair sharing the ring for the wbo super welterweight title this year in the aftermath.smith, who defeated john thompson to claim the belt earlier this month, will make a quick first defense in promoter frank warren’s ‘xmas cracker’ show alongside the massive middleweight blockbuster between andy lee and billy joe saunders.as it currently stands, mosley is tentative about signing on the dotted line due to the terms involved regarding a possible second fight, although the 44 year-old hopes the encounter will be finalized in the next 24 hours.“i might take the fight with liam smith, but they say we must have a rematch clause,” mosley exclusively told world boxing news.“i have a fight on the table for early 2016 so i can’t do that easily. i told them that if the win is close that they can have a rematch within eight weeks or it would then have to wait until after october 2016.

“but if i ko him early then there can’t be a rematch provision because the fans won’t want to buy that and it would be pointless. if they come back and agree this, then the fight will happen 100%.“it should be a huge sell-out and will be my first fight in the uk,” he added.if rubberstamped, the bout at manchester arena would represent a 23rd world title fight for mosley, who has already won world titles in three weight classes during a stellar career.the californian has shared the ring with top names like floyd mayweather, manny pacquiao, miguel cotto and oscar de la hoya and would be seen as a major coup for warren if he can take the seasoned champion to british soil.smith, 27, became the first of four fighting brothers from liverpool to win a recognised belt when pummelling thompson in seven rounds on october 10 and will be able to make a name for himself stateside with a proposed victory over mosley.
