"the number of coaches has tripled over the last year and the number of domestic instructors is ten times higher than before. we have also established 18 elite pro academies for liga 1 clubs that focus on u-16 player development. secondly, a referee development programme was initiated to set up a new referee management system and operation cycle. over 1,207 referees were selected for a quality workshop and a new management system has been set up for the referee department, starting from administration to an education team."to achieve this important endeavour, the pssi used the help of the fifa forward development programme, in order to ensure that all referees receive the necessary training they need to enable them to take part in international competitions.the elements of a strong referee programme are incorporated into education, evaluation and communication, which are pssiâs main focal points for the project. coaches are key to providing education, evaluation and feedback and conducting annual assessment courses; instructor courses are also a paramount element of this strategy.hiring experienced international assessors to observe league referees and national referees is also an important aspect since internationally-hired assessors will also mentor and monitor the new indonesian assessors."fifa forwardâs support is the foundation of pssi's football development, focusing on capacity building for coaches, referees and players to reach our long-term target in 2045, starting from 2024 as the first milestone and 2034 as the second milestone," said pssi vice president mr. joko driyono. "pssi would like to thank the full support of fifa's member association development and regional development office, who were of great help to us during the process of planning and execution. we realise that there is still so much room for improvement and pssi is thankful to fifa, who always supports us in this long journey to reach our vision."eventually the aim will be to create two categories of referees and coaches (assessors and instructors, national and regional coaches). this will undoubtedly boost local refereeing and coaching in the lead up to many international competitions.2018 filanesia programme in numbers:development13 may 2016fifa forward02 oct 2018development17 dec 2018
