by  aubrey allegretti, political reporter  thursday 21 february 2019 07:32, ukthree mps have quit the conservative party and claimed prime minister theresa may has failed to unite the country around brexit.the group - anna soubry, sarah wollaston and heidi allen - declared the "battle is over" and an "awkward squad" of hardline leavers were now running the party "from top to toe".they shocked onlookers, filing into parliament to shake hands and sit with their new partners, the newly-formed independent group - set up by disillusioned former labour mps.their defection boosts the number of mps sitting in the new independent group to 11, with liberal democrat leader sir vince cable immediately raising the prospect of an electoral pact at the next general election.he told sky news: "where we're talking about people who have a very similar position to us politically, we will probably want to try and help them."my instinct is that we will want to cooperate," he added.ms allen named the trio of conservative defectors the "three amigos", as she led a dramatic news conference where each explained their decision to cut mrs may's slim majority even further.the south cambridgeshire mp picked up the issue of welfare, saying "too often" she went "over the top to fight for benevolence in our benefits system".she also accused mrs may of being "bullied into submission" by the european research group (erg) of tory eurosceptics.the 11 mps that make up the independent group may look like one already, but they are not yet a bona fide political partyms wollaston, chair of the health select committee, skewered the prime minister for failing to tackle the "burning injustices" she promised to do so in her first speech on the steps of downing street."if i wouldn't encourage others to vote conservative in a general election, then how can i possibly continue with the conservative whip?" the totnes mp asked.rounding off the speeches was anna soubry, who claimed an infiltration by hard-right activists had turned the party into "bluekip"."the right-wing, the hardline anti-eu awkward squad that have destroyed every leader for the last 40 years are now running the conservative party from top to toe," she declared.taking questions from the media, ms allen said a "significant" number of other tory mps could quit and but that "everyone will get there in their own time".she warned mrs may to change her tack on brexit or else the three defections on tuesday would only be "a taste of what's to come".her and ms soubry explicitly ruled out ever returning to the conservatives, despite downing street leaving the door open to them to return.addressing calls for the three to call by-elections and stand again as independent mps, ms allen tore into the two major parties."this is what the big parties do; they want to crush the birth of democracy," she said."this is the game they play, but we're better than that and we think the country and our constituents deserve better than that."mrs may said in a statement she was "saddened" by the departures.she admitted: "of course, the uk's membership of the eu has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy."but by delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the british people we are doing the right thing for our country."and in doing so, we can move forward together towards a brighter future."i am determined that under my leadership the conservative party will always offer the decent, moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve."former prime minister david cameron has also said he is "sad that three talented tory mps have left the party"."i respect their decision, but disagree with them," he added.labour leader jeremy corbyn repeated his demand for those mps who have quit his party to trigger by-elections in their constituencies, as he attacked the independent group for representing the "politics of the past".sign our petition to make party leaders take part in televised election debatesin a video posted to his twitter account, mr corbyn said: "it's disappointing that some mps have left our party to sit with disaffected tory mps."but we cannot return to the failed, business-as-usual politics of the past. it's only labour that offers solutions to the challenges people face today."he added the "decent and democratic thing" for those mps who have quit labour to do is to resign from parliament and "put themselves up for election".
