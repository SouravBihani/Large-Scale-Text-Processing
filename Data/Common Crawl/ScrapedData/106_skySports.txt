by  harry carr, head of sky data  tuesday 19 february 2019 19:53, ukthe newly-formed independent group of mps who split from labour on monday are already ahead of the lib dems in popularity, according to a sky data poll.having been unveiled in a press conference, 10% already say they would vote for them in a general election if they had a candidate in their constituency - ahead of the liberal democrats on 9% and ukip on 6%.the conservatives are on 32%, with labour on just 26%.the vote for the independent group comes from a variety of sources - 37% of those who say they would vote for them now voted for labour in 2017, 27% for the conservatives, 24% from people who did not vote and 6% from the liberal democrats.the group have not formally established themselves as a political party yet, but this could happen at some point in the not too distant future.following one of the labour splitters - luciana berger - decrying antisemitism within labour, more agree than disagree both that the party is institutionally antisemitic, and that leader jeremy corbyn is personally antisemitic.one in three (34%) say labour is institutionally antisemitic, with 23% saying the party is not and 43% unsure - and similarly 35% think mr corbyn himself is personally antisemitic, 24% think he is not and 41% answered "don't know".this comes as both main parties are seen as divided and poorly-led by the vast majority of the public.seven in 10 think the labour party (69%) and the conservative party (69%) are divided, and identically just 15% think each are united.the majority of britons think mr corbyn would be a bad prime minister - 55% say bad, 22% good.and remarkably, they also think labour mps agree with them - 53% think mr corbyn's own mps think he would be a bad prime minister, just 22% think they think he would do a good job.sign our petition to make party leaders take part in televised election debatesit's little better for theresa may - 49% of the public think she is a bad prime minister, 37% a good one.and again, more think her own mps regard her as a bad prime minister (49%) than a good one (33%).:: sky data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,034 uk adults online on 19 february 2019. data are weighted to the profile of the population. sky data is a member of the british polling council and abides by its rules.for full sky data tables, please click here.
