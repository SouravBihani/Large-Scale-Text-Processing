a highlight of post game tonight: giannis was wearing a powder pink nike tech fleece sweatsuit and as he was walking up to the podium, he got on his tiptoes and sang the pink panther song.giannis said that any frustration he showed during the game came from his body hurting. he said he thinks mike budenholzer has done a good job limiting his minutes.the bucks defeat the pistons 120-99 and head to detroit with a 2-0 lead in the series. while blake griffin hasn't played a second of this series, he picked up his second technical foul tonight -- tying kevin durant and patrick beverley for the most techs this postseason.blake griffin gets a technical foul (again) from the bench. he was also issued a tech in game 1.pacers coach nate mcmillan sums up what happened to his team in the fourth quarter with one sentence: "we have to finish."after boston went on an 8-0 run with kyrie irving on the bench to pull within 4, he's come in and hit back to back 3s to put boston ahead 84-82 with 5:25 to go. the pacers have hit another cold spell - 8 straight misses, several of which bounced around the rim before falling off.kyrie irving and jayson tatum have a combined 48 points on 21-36 shooting. the rest of the celtics have scored 30 combined, and are shooting 12-33.al horford is trying to make his presence felt here in the fourth quarter. already has two quick buckets - his first of the game. boston has pulled back to within six.after making his first three shots of this series, marcus morris has missed 15 of his 17 shot attempts since then. morris has tailed off over the second half of the season, but boston needs production from him with marcus smart sidelined indefinitely.the pacers have a 79-68 lead after three quarters here in boston. after indiana scored eight points in the third quarter in game 1, the celtics have dug themselves a hole in game 2 with a 16-point third quarter of their own.before the game, dwane casey stressed the importance of a strong first quarter for the pistons. in game 1, the pistons trailed by 20 after one. in game 2 today, the pistons trail by just 11. shooting just 5-of-16 from 3 is hurting them.al horford is playing tonight, but he's clearly not right. in 21 minutes he's only taken two shots, and he hasn't scored. understandably looks a step or two slow, too, after being questionable to play with an illness.celtics worked hard to get bojan bogdanovic onto kyrie irving for the final possession, and it went as boston expected it would — with irving driving and hitting a runner off the glass to make it celtics 52, pacers 50 at halftime.thaddeus young has already taken more shots (10) than he did all of game 1 (8). and after not taking a single 3 in game 1, he's already taken 4. pacers have made a bunch of concerted decisions to try to create more offense, and so far they are working.couple notable adjustments from the pacers: trying to get shots off earlier, and inserting aaron holiday into the rotation in place of tj leaf. really like the idea of holiday playing over leaf, as indiana needs as many shot creators as it can get.after making four shots in all of game 1, bojan bogdanovic has made four of his first five shots in game 2 for indiana. the pacers need bogdanovic to have big games to have a chance in this series.blake griffin is listed as inactive for the pistons game 2 against the bucks.dwane casey says a decision hasn't been made on whether or not blake griffin is a go for game 2 against the bucks. casey says the medical staff will evaluate him between now and tip off. "i want him to play, blake wants to play, but it's about how his body feels," casey said.al horford has been officially upgraded to available for tonight's game, as expected.stevens follows up by saying that horford felt very sick last night, but woke up this morning feeling much better, though he stayed home from shootaround. based on how stevens talked about it, would be very surprised if horford can't play tonight.brad stevens says al horford is going to "try to give it a go" tonight. he will go through warmups and see where things are after that. horford was listed as questionable with an illness.harden so disrespectful for this move ... if only he had made the shot � pic.twitter.com/6ugjuq5cb9 to help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?
