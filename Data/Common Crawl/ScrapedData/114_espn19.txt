fernando tatis jr., batting .281/.347/.578 through the first 18 games of his major league career, has moved into the leadoff spot. padres manager andy green said they kicked the idea around for more than a week and felt he was ready. green has been impressed by the way tatis has adjusted in-game. he brought up last night, when he had three bad at-bats and then doubled off the wall in his fourth. "it's resilient baseball," green said, "and as long as that's the case, you feel like whatever you throw at him he's going to be fine."mike ford will make his mlb debut tonight as clint frazier gets back in left for the opener vs. kansas city:
