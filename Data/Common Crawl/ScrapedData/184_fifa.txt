          fifa, together with the international football association board (ifab), is inviting producers of electronic performance and tracking systems (epts), including wearable and camera-based technologies, to present their systems to both organisations. details on possible quality criteria, testing procedures and preventive medical benefits for players will be discussed at meetings taking place during the week of 16 november.with many teams and players already using epts devices for training purposes, in order to control and improve their performance, requests have been made to the ifab to permit players to also wear such devices during matches. football’s rule-making body approved the use of wearable technology in principle at its 129th annual business meeting in belfast on 28 february this year. however, the decision was based on two conditions: that, until epts are proven to have preventive medical benefits, their data cannot be used in real time within the technical area, and that wearable systems must not pose any danger to anyone on the field of play during the match. therefore, further research and market analysis are needed for a quality assessment of the different systems available, the use of data, and the licensing process.   the ifab subsequently provided fifa with the mandate for the development of a quality programme for epts, similar to those already in place for goal-line technology, footballs and football turf. the fifa quality programme was introduced in 1996 and has helped to set the industry standard for quality and reliability in the areas where it matters to football players most: the equipment, surface, technology and services used for the game.  companies interested in participating in the meeting can contact quality@fifa.org. the invitation is only open to producers of electronic performance and tracking systems and is valid until the end of october 2015.   further details on the launch of a global standard for epts will be provided in due course.   *for further information, please visit:
