we are big arsenal fans and are really worried about the lack of width we have up front. is it true that arsenal are looking to sign barcelona outcast malcolm and will it be permanent?p.s i sent in a question during the first season and the standards haven’t dropped since love the podcast keep up the great workonly just come across this but so far enjoyed. liked les ferdinand won today talking about his career. he played little bit before my era les but was a good player and love a story where they come through the ranks late.delighted to have the podcast back boys! i wrote in about a year ago asking about the ‘coutinho saga’ wanting him gone and replaced  with a decent keeper and centre back. a year down the line, that’s exactly what’s happened and now we are gonna win he league! not that i like to brag ! keep up the good work thank for a great listen on my commutes around the country!
