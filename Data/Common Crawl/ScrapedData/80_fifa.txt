          the fifa u-17 women’s world cup uruguay 2018 served as the ideal context for a new fifa regional course for women’s football, held in montevideo from 12 to 21 november.“the course consists of both theory sessions, which include analysis of matches at the world cup, and practical sessions, where we transfer what we’ve been studying in theory,” fifa coach andrea rodebaugh explained to fifa.com.at a glancea wide spectrum of subjects are covered, ranging from specific topics – such as working with goalkeepers and issues related to menstruation – to more general matters including injury prevention and psychology in women’s football.“in addition to match analysis, it’s also important to analyse what the profile of an international footballer should be. that information contributes to efforts to be more competitive at the world level,” added rodebaugh.18 nov 2018andrea rodebaugh during a regional coaching course during the fifa u-17 women's world cup uruguay 2018 on november 18, 2018 in montevideo, uruguay.

among those participating in the course were the head coaches of senior, u-17 and u-20 national teams, as well as assistant coaches, physical trainers and women’s football academy coaches.they included figures who have already left their mark on women’s football in south america, such as uruguayan graciela rebollo.currently coordinator of women's football at liverpool in montevideo, six years ago she was in charge of the first ever uruguayan women’s team to reach a fifa world cup™, when her u-17 side qualified for azerbaijan 2012.venezuelan jose catoya and paraguayan epifania benitez also attended the course. both coaches are currently in charge of their countries’ u-20 national teams and have experience of leading their sides at papua new guinea 2016 and france 2018, respectively.what they said
“a course like this one is extremely important because it serves to refresh ideas, something that we need in this part of the world. the fact that it’s during a world cup gives you plenty of material, because you’re seeing at first hand other perspectives on the game, via analysis that goes beyond just our south american rivals. it’s really enriching.”
jose catoya, head coach of the venezuela u-20 national team.“the workshop is an important chance to compare professional experiences, to see how and how much football might be growing in our country. sometimes, when you’re concentrating on the job at hand, you don’t notice that growth. but we’ve taken positive conclusions from it."
luis pescarolo, head coach of the ecuador national team.“i’m leaving with several valuable pieces of information, like everything we did related to psychological work with the girls. not just in terms of how to manage victory or defeat, but also how to monitor their progress at home. that’s been something new."
