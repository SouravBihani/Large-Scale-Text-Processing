"there is no doubt that this is a great step forward for the development of football in the kyrgyz republic."as a result, eight clubs in the kyrgyz republic top league have been provided with minibuses so far. with the support of the fifa forward programme, major improvements are being driven onwards in this central asian nation.ð¡ðµð³ð¾ð´ð½ñ, 3 ð½ð¾ñð±ññ ð ñðºð¾ð²ð¾ð´ññð²ð¾ ð¤ðµð´ðµñð°ñð¸ð¸ ñññð±ð¾ð»ð° ðð  ð¸ ð¤ññð±ð¾ð»ñð½ð¾ð¹ ðð¸ð³ð¸ ðññð³ñð·ññð°ð½ð° ð¸ ð² ñð°ð¼ðºð°ñ ð¿ñð¾ð³ñð°ð¼ð¼ñ â«fifa forwardâ»...development22 jan 2019development11 jan 2019fifa forward06 nov 2018fifa forward07 nov 2018fifa forward02 oct 201813 may 2016development13 jun 2018
