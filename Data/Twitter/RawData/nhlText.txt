Los Flyers se llevan la victoria por 5-4 sobre los Maple Leafs en el shootout.
Sean Couturier se encargó de anotar el definitivo. Carter Hart no dejó pasar uno.

#NHL"

Konecny, Gudas y Couturier remontaron un déficit de dos goles para convertirlo en un superávit de uno con un periodo restante.

Buena presión de Toronto en zona enemiga para robar el puck en frente de Hart. 
Brown para Kadri y éste para dentro.

Carter Hart. Frederik Andersen.

Rask at @TBLightning is a tall task, but should be tight game. @NHLBruins have something to prove again. 

Bish at @NHLJets a bit easier, surprised by this price. #NHL #DFS"
