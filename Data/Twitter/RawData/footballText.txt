"6314" "When the new BBC Scotland channel started &amp; premiered 'View From The Terraces', I was happy because this is a world I love - Scottish league football chat. And it's a great show. Funny &amp; insightful &amp; irreverent. And yet not a single woman. Six lads. Surely that can't be right."
"6315" "I'm sure many women have been saying these things for years without affecting BBC Scotland. I know @LesleyRiddoch speaks about it often. If anyone is out there working on this issue do let me know &amp; I'll RT etc. More women's voices on BBC Scotland football coverage please!"

"6319" "I want BBC Scotland to broadcast &amp; discuss football. I love it. But it can't go on like this. The Scottish Women's team is the only good international side we have just now. Women are players, fans, commentators, officials, coaches. It has to change."
