"294" "#MLB #FREEPLAY 4/1/19:

Indians -1 (-110)

I like backing Clevinger here, his splits vs. this ChiSox lineup is fav. holding oppo. to a ~low OPS and BAA, while Nova has surrrendered a 1.269 OPS to this Indians lineup and over a .400 BAA similarly. Cold weather (1/2)"
"295" "Prefaced a #MLB game last night, will probably be adding that line aswell.

Definitely see the pitching discrepancy, normally I'd side w/ a pitcher his first time facing a lineup (unfamiliarity, etc) but I'm factoring in the quick escalation here from a lower minor league."

"1817" "For all the hype surrounding M Mikolas, I was a little surprised that no1 at all cared about Dereck Rodriguez pre-season. I put out a bold prediction he'd finish over Mikolas, and as a contact manager in SF, this early start continues to build on a strong 18 #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1818" "Nimmo struck out again on a pitch up in the zone? It's almost like the league adjusted to the fact that he can't at all handle pitches in the top 3rd of the K-Zone 🧐 #MLB #FantasyBaseball 

https://t.co/Wm6t9O5cq7"
"1819" "Was pretty high on Reynaldo Lopez entering the season. This is 1 of those starts I think you can't make too much of, unless you want to make a big deal about the diminished velo. Lopez averaged 95 and touched 99 last year on Brooks. Sat 93 and hit 96 today. #MLB #FantasyBaseball"

"1822" "4-Hit game for Jeff McNeil. Second XBH. 0 Ks. That brings him to 2 XBH and 0 Ks on the season, and 72 XBH and 66 Ks in the last two seasons between AA-MLB. Buckle up. #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1823" "In honor of Bogaerts (my dynasty SS) signing a new extension with the Boston Red Sox:
Bogaerts had, in my opinion, the most legitimate breakout of his career in 2018. Statistically, one of my absolute favorite growths is Isolated Power v. Off-Speed/Breaking. #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1824" "Nimmo has now put the ball in play once in 8 PAs. 2 BBs / 5 Ks. #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1825" "Crazy comps time: Ryon Healy's swing and follow-thru has always reminded me of Mike Trout. Maybe it's just the strong use of two-hands, but it is really just his allergy to BBs that has held him back in the past. I think theres a low-key stud here somewhere. #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1826" "Tyler Naquin batting 3rd again. Has 171 Career ABs v. 4SFB w/ a .281 SLG%, 1 HR, and 86 Ks. Not a starter. Not a three hitter. #MLB #FantasyBaseball Friendly reminder, Cleveland, that Larry Dolan is not your friend."
"1827" "Pivetta fastball just has zero life to me. And the more he has performances where he gives up a ton of hits and runs despite low BBs and High Ks, the more I believe that is Fastball is simply too hittable. #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1828" "In 4 PAs (2019), Greg Allen has drawn a BB and knocked in a clutch Sac Fly. In 8 PAs, Tyler Naquin has struck out 7 times. There is one player of the two that MIGHT be an everyday OFer. He also, for fantasy, has Mallex Smith-esque upside. Catch up, Cleveland #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1829" "Can anyone tell me if Sandy Alcantara made a physical change in anyway like Snell did standing on a different side of the rubber? Still wild in a sense, but was very surprised honestly by how much he was in and around the K-Zone #MLB #FantasyBaseball"
"1830" "I watch multiple games at a time, so I can't be confident in what I feel about even this start for Pablo Lopez. But from what I have seen both on the screen, on paper, and in reactions suggests that he may not be a player you can wait on. #MLB #Fantasybaseball"
"1831" "Someone needs to give Terry Francona a swift kick in the rear. Maybe it'll knock his head out of there and he'll realize that Tyler Naquin isn't an everyday starter at the MLB level 🙄. So much for liking Greg Allen. Incompetency reigns supreme. #MLB #FantasyBaseball https://t.co/Bq7OONWf96"
"1832" "If they're going to play Jose Ramirez like that, he's got to go Oppo more. He's got way too much bat control and bat-to-ball skills to not be able to simply slap a ball into the Outfield when there's absolutely no one on the left side of the infield #MLB #FantasyBaseball"

"1836" "presumed holes in swing, he is allowing pitchers to dictate ABs, instead of the other way around which is the typical adv of being a highly selective hitter. McNeil should be leading off and will be sooner or later, depending on how soon teh Mets catch up #MLB #FantasyBaseball"

"3594" "TOR: Giles locks it down for SV (1 H/2 K). Is he the best closer in the game? Absolutely not, but he's among the safest and therefore should be viewed as a solid CL2 #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3595" "MIL: Talk about an impressive performance, Hader earned the SV by striking out the side...  On just 9 pitches!  The only thing holding him back is the team's desire to keep him flexible otherwise he'd be a Top 5 option #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3596" "WAS: Doolittle got credited w/BSV after allowing inherited runners to score (1.2 IP/0 R/3 H/0 BB/2 K). It wasn't his best showing, but the only real risk is in regards to injury &amp; nothing more #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3597" "SEA: Gearrin opened the 9th but struggled (0.1 IP/1 R/0 H/3 K) and was lifted for Bradford (0.2 IP/1 BB/1 K/SV). With Swarzak closing in on return, don't be surprised if he's quickly installed into the role #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3598" "SF: Smith earned SV (perfect IP/2 K), but it was Moronta who was the most impressive (2.0 IP/0 R/1 H/0 BB/5 K). It may take a trade to get there, but don't be surprised if Moronta is saving games by year's end #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3599" "CLE: Hand made it interesting but ultimately locked down SV (1.0 IP/1 H/2 BB/1 K). Considering that the team has no true alternative, he's really going to have to struggle in order to lose his role. Use him with confidence #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3600" "TB: With Jose Alvarado having worked back-to-back days it was Diego Castillo called on for SV &amp; does the job (1.0 IP/1 BB). Hast the stuff to thrive in the role if given the chance, &amp; while it's hard to expect he's worth stashing in case #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3601" "BAL: Givens entered in the 8th, which made sense if they were going to use him for a 6 out SV. Instead after adding on runs he was pulled (1.0 IP/1 H/3 K) &amp; the Orioles almost blew the game. Look for him to stick out the opp next time #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3602" "MIN: Parker appeared to be saved for the 9th, albeit in a non-SV, but he ultimately took the L allowing 1 R/1 H/1 BB. It'll be interesting to see how this shakes out, but Rogers was used in 8th &amp; got 1st SV opp. At this point he's the favorite #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3603" "LAD: Can Kenley Jansen return to being among the elite closers in the league?  It's hard to imagine, but he got off to a good start w/a perfect IP (1 K) to pick up the SV #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3604" "SD: Yates is doing his best to prove that he belongs in the conversation as one of the best options in the league as he already picked up his 3rd SV. With the Padres trying to compete there should be plenty of more opps #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3605" "MIA: Despite struggling in his first appearance Romo gets a SV opp &amp; delivers (perfect IP/1 K). It's possible he gets the bulk of the opportunities, though don't underestimate both Steckenrider &amp; Conley getting their chances #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3606" "BAL: This time the Orioles try to get six outs from Givens but he falls short (1.2 IP/1 R/2 H/2 BB/1 K) after 49 pitches. Want to think that he'll be \"the man\" but the usage &amp; talk of \"flexible\" situation makes him tough to trust #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3607" "OAK: Treinen was called on for 5 out SV and did the job (1 H/2 K). He's picked up right where he left off in '18, with a 0.00 ERA and 0.21 WHIP over 4.2 IP to start the season &amp; is one of the elite in the game #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3608" "PIT: Interesting to see Vazquez used in a non-SV opp.  He was pulled after getting into trouble (0.2 IP/1 H/1 BB/1 K), which makes sense having thrown 25 pitches. Don't read into this at all. #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3609" "TB: It was a lights out performance for Alvarado, who earned his 2nd SV w/a perfect IP &amp; 2 K. Castillo is going to be considered an alternative, but for now it should be viewed as Alvarado's role to lose #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3610" "KC: After the debacle in their first SV opportunity, is it a surprise that they went in a different direction? As we predicted it was Kennedy who got the opp &amp; while he made it interesting (2 H/1 K) he did job. At this point he's worth adding #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"

"3613" "STL: Talk about a disaster, Hicks took BSV (0.1 IP/2 R/3 H), but it's not like Reyes (0.2 IP/1 R/0 H/1 BB/1 K) or Miller (1.0 IP/1 R/2 H/1 BB/1 K) were impressive. Good chance Hicks gets next opp but any of the three could emerge #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3614" "NYM: Talk about a gift SV, after almost coughing up a 7 R lead Diaz enters and needs 1 pitch to get the final out &amp; earn SV. There's already a good chance that he reaches 40+ SV, but days like this only help pad the number #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3615" "TEX: Leclerc called on four 4 out SV &amp; delivers (1.1 IP/0 R/1 BB/1 K). As we've said he has the stuff to be among the better options in the league &amp; after signing the extension there's no longer the risk of a trade #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"

"3618" "ARI: Think Bradley (1.0 IP/2 BB/2 K) or Hirano (1.0 IP/3 R/2 H/0 BB/2 K) could push Holland for the closers role? It's only been a handful of games, but for the short-term that doesn't appear to be a concern #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3619" "TEX: A solid showing for Leclerc, who allowed 1 H en route to his 1st SV of the season.  The big concern had been the potential for a trade, but with his extension in place he should be a solid option all year long #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"

"3622" "DET: Greene solid again (1 H/SV) while Jimenez coughs up lead in 8th (3 ER/3 H/1 K/1.0 IP). Still believe that latter will eventually get an opportunity, but for now Greene is 100% safe in role #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"
"3623" "SEA: With Strickland hitting the DL Rosscup was called on for 9th (non-SV) &amp; he was shaky (though defense didn't help) allowing 3 R (0 ER)/1 H/1 BB/0.2 IP. Rumbelow got final out but w/Swarzak close he could step in immediately #MLB #FantasyBaseball #closers"

Prices have doubled or tripled in many markets since 2010."
"4033" "@thatdodgerlife @TeamStubHub @MLB Yep. It’s a practice #mlb needs to stop. All it does is forces the public to pay 30%+ in stubhub fees on top of the premium prices. Dodgers hide behind stubhub and blame “resellers”."

It’s not just the rays. This is the problem across #Mlb. I’m just picking on the rays first. The rest of the teams will get it shortly"
"4035" "@thatdodgerlife @TeamStubHub That was before they officially partnered with @mlb and had to increase fees to offset the fees they were giving back to #mlb. It was also before teams started selling their tickets directly and indirectly on stubhub. Now stubhub is just a shield for Mlb to charge premiums."
"4036" "Against one of the best teams in the AL, you should be able to sell 25k seats for a Sunday afternoon game. Of course in order to do this, consider a price that would not exceed demand. Fill the stadium. Those seats should be no more than $40. The dynamic pricing is broken in #Mlb"
