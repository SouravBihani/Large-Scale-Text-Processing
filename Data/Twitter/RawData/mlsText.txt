"3303" "#NERevs in a pretty straightforward 4-4-2 in the early stages here. Caldwell and Gil in central midfield. #NEvMIN #MLS"

"4486" "La llegada a la #MLS de un Guardiola aún en la cumbre de los banquillos sería brutal a efectos de marketing para la liga. Si bien, no me parece lo mejor para #NYCFC: el camino correcto pasa más por traer un técnico que conozca la liga (Vermes, por ej.) con proyecto a largo plazo."
"4487" "La clasificación no miente: el inicio de #NERevs ha sido catastrófico (últimos del Este), pero creo que el 'roster' no es malo. Con 3-4 refuerzos de nivel, este equipo sería muy distinto; para mejor. Ah… ¡y el #FCCincy va 2º clasificado! Mantengo mi apuesta por 'play-offs'. #MLS"

"5705" "VOD: Mate it's a penalty. Alonso is wrong side, does make an attempt on the ball but he has to go through the player to get to it. Shame cause Minnesota look better organized.

#LAGalaxy 1-0 #MNUFC #MLS #Football"
"5706" "VOD: Look I don't care if a game stops for 10-15 minutes. If it's to absolutely make sure a player can/can't continue, take the time needed. We can't have concussed players on the pitch.

#ForeverOrange 3-2 #VWFC #MLS #Football"
"5707" "VOD: Orlando just getting burnt on the left side of the field.

#FaceOfCity 0-2 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5708" "VOD: New England's defensive shape just isn't there. Been getting burnt at both left and right back all game.

#TFCLive 3-2 #NERevs #MLS #Football"
"5709" "VOD: God damn. Justin Morrow how ya ankles feeling? You looking like Elaine right now, been made to dance.

#TFCLive 3-2 #NERevs #MLS #Football"
"5710" "VOD: This isn't a red card offense, they just came together. Should be just a foul.

#FaceOfCity 0-2 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5711" "VOD: RSL have no presence in this game whatsoever. No ball possession and inviting DC onto the wings.

#DCU 0-0 #RSL #MLS #Football"
"5712" "VOD: Certainly for this season Colorado look like a team that is rebuilding in the right way and making steps forward. The same cannot be said in a stagnant New England.

#Rapids96 0-0 #ForGloryForCity #MLS #Football #NERevs"
"5713" "VOD: The Galaxy get a corner off the play in the 9th minute but it's at the generosity of a deflection. They did not spread wide enough to work the ball anywhere &amp; the shot from 25 yds was the only option left. No movement off the ball either.

#LAGalaxy 0-0 #MNUFC #MLS #Football"
"5714" "VOD: You cannot lose the ball out of the back. I hate 4-2-3-1s or 4-4-2s or 4-3-3s that push the wingbacks forward without the ball. They're there to overlap or drive with the ball, not be forward options from the back.

#DCU 2-0 #RSL #MLS #Football"
"5715" "VOD: Orlando can have no complaints. 2 defensive miscues in front of goal and a rush of blood to the head to be reduced to 10 men late.

#FaceOfCity 1-3 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5716" "VOD: The 16th and 17th minutes are the difference between these two sides. Galaxy has 6 shots, none close to target. Minnesota counter whisking one just wide.

#LAGalaxy 0-0 #MNUFC #MLS #Football"
"5717" "VOD: I don't know what the central defense was doing but Orlando caught high left them exposed for the ball over the top and only the trailing wingback putting in effort to break up the play that fell away from him.

#FaceofCity 0-1 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5718" "VOD: Man... the absolutely lack of shape and uniformity with New England is awful. They haven't had much to work with but Freidel's not really given them anything either.

#TFCLive 2-1 #NERevs #MLS #Football"
"5719" "VOD: Why... do you even... make a challenge like that???

Awful challenge. Mavinga??? Hello???

Stonewall penalty.

#TFCLive 0-1 #NERevs #MLS #Football"
"5720" "VOD: Didn't think it deserved a booking but O'Neill is having a shocker.

#FaceofCity 0-2 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5721" "VOD: Excellent game of football.

#ForeverOrange 3-2 #VWFC #MLS #Football"
"5722" "VOD: Wow. That was not a threatening ball how is it in the back of the net?

#TFCLive 2-2 #NERevs #MLS #Football"
"5723" "VOD: Now that is a brilliant way to move the ball. Pulled the wingback out wide and the pass from Boateng was absolutely class. A delicious ball. Beautiful football.

#LAGalaxy 2-0 #MNUFC #MLS #Football"
"5724" "VOD: Akinola take a bow. That move to get free and find space for the shot. Absolutely oozes class. Brilliant goal.

#TFCLive 1-1 #NERevs #MLS #Football"
"5725" "VOD: There's really nothing you can do but laugh at Orlando's defense.

#FaceOfCity 0-2 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5726" "VOD: I'm not really a fan of the 4-1-4-1 but putting Pontius that far back is not ideal. I understand at 31 he's not the best option at forward wing but you're playing him out of position in the back 4.

#LAGalaxy 0-0 #MNUFC #MLS #Football"
"5727" "VOD: RSL having a nightmare.

#DCU 5-0 #RSL #Football #MLS"
"5728" "VOD: My skepticism was misplaced by this LA performance. Looked very fluid on offense.

#LAGalaxy 3-1 #MNUFC #MLS #Football"
"5729" "VOD: Orlando definitely have threats forward with the likes of Nani and Dwyer but defensively they look lost.

#FaceofCity 0-2 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5730" "VOD: Rodriguez's goal is sublime. RSL to 9 men this is a complete capitulation from them.

#DCU 4-0 #RSL #MLS #Football"
"5731" "VOD: It doesn't matter if a player \"ducks into\" a high boot like the RSL commentators suggest, the boot shouldn't be that high. The argument for a yellow card can be made that it is a toe poke &amp; not a stud. Really 50/50 call to the ref: yellow/red.

#DCU 2-0 #RSL #MLS #Football"
"5732" "VOD: Quinto idk about that. Borderline red card. Very dangerous, very obvious, and direct contact to the head while leaning with the arm. Should have been off.

#ForeverOrange 3-2 #VWFC #MLS #Football"
"5733" "VOD: Peter Vermes is the Jose Mourinho of the MLS.

The amount of slow, suffocating football he is willing to play on the road in this league is unparalleled.

Without the mistake this game would be a 0-0 lock.

#Rapids96 1-0 #ForGloryForCity #MLS #Football"
"5734" "VOD: Johnny Russel. What a free kick.

On the Bloomberg free kick... it's a soft 2nd yellow. It's not a play Bloomberg needed to make he did kick the ball away but is it worth sending a player of for that? I don't know...

#Rapids96 1-1 #ForGloryForCity #MLS #Football"
"5735" "VOD: A defensive mistake from Tim Melia. That's a rarity. Colorado not worth their lead though this game has been stale.

#Rapids96 1-0 #ForGloryForCity #MLS #Football"
"5736" "VOD: Montreal definitely the better team but it's not like Orlando has made it hard for them with 2 mistakes at central defense. You can't gift goals like that.

#FaceOfCity 0-3 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5737" "VOD: Orlando's issues present in the opening minute: defensively coughing the ball up. Defense is a shambles at a club that has good pieces elsewhere.

#FaceOfCity 0-0 #IMFC #MLS #Football"
"5738" "VOD: Yes it is a penalty but it couldn't have been refereed in a more sloppy fashion.
