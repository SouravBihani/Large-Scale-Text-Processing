The latest effort is the Alliance of American Football, which plays its first games on Saturday.There have been plenty of pretenders to the N.F.L.’s crown over the years. None have succeeded, but all had their share of novelty.Season July to DecemberWeird rules A touchdown was worth seven points; teams could then go for a conversion from scrimmage for one more “action point.” No sudden-death overtime; a full 15-minute quarter was played.

It’s as if another baseball league was formed with a season that opened in December.”Legacy Introduced instant replay for officials’ rulings; won antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L. but was awarded only $3 in damages.Season February to AprilWeird rules Players could have nicknames on their jerseys; two players raced for the football to determine opening possession; no fair catches.Champion Los Angeles XtremeOdd team names New York/New Jersey Hitmen, Memphis ManiaxBig-name owner All teams owned by World Wrestling Federation and NBCBig-name coaches Ron Meyer, Chicago Enforcers; Al Luginbill, Los AngelesBig name players Rod “He Hate Me” Smart, Las Vegas Outlaws; Rashaan Salaam, MemphisStrange occurrence A double overtime game caused “Saturday Night Live” to be delayed by 45 minutes, infuriating the producer Lorne Michaels. Subsequently, NBC cut away from the games at 11 p.m. even if they were not over.TV NBCThe Times said: “Like a blight that has crept from the low-rent fringes of cable to network prime time, the XFL mingles violence, voyeurism and even politics into one trashy Saturday night show.”Legacy Unusual camera angles, including Skycam; a return planned for next year.Season October to NovemberWeird rules Blitzes limited to six players; single-bar face mask permitted.Champions Las Vegas Locomotives (three times), Virginia DestroyersOdd team name Florida TuskersBig-name owners Mark Cuban was an investor.

BetDSI has the Arizona Hotshots as the favorites.TV CBS, CBS Sports Network, TNT and NFL NetworkThe Times said: “The Alliance of American Football, though, will have to overcome the obstacles that others could not, including runaway expenses, limited media exposure and a lack of fans.”Maybe a fierce rivalry will develop between San Diego and Phoenix. Maybe a player will break out the way “He Hate Me” did in the XFL. Maybe Coach Spurrier will recapture his magic. The Alliance will have to roll a Yahtzee to succeed in the shadow of the N.F.L. But even if it fails, you can bet someone will soon line up to try again.Advertisement
