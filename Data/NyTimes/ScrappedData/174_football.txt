I wasn’t ashamed, but neither was I proud. Back in the day, I remember cutting high school and taking the subway to the Village to experience, if only briefly, a different slice of life. The city was grittier back then, literally with grime and pollution, but also with higher crime or just the sotto voce offers in Washington Square of “Hey, man, want some acid?” But I wouldn’t trade my Queens days for anything. Our unrivaled, however simple, cuisine — arguably the best pizza and bagels in town. Playing ball every day: basketball in the backyard of a friend who was lucky enough to have a hoop; football under Friday night lights in the supermarket parking lot, its stripes used to determine first downs; and baseball in the streets, where we relied on manhole covers, car taillights and the like for bases. And, of course, the great friends, alas too few of whom I’ve kept up with over the years.Neil G. BennettStamford, Conn.Advertisement
