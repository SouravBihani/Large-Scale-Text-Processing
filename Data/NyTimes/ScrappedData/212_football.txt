Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.‘The Puppy Bowl’ When to watch: Sunday at 3 p.m., on Animal Planet.This is Puppy Bowl XV, and this year’s festivities include a sloth referee, kangaroo joey cheerleaders, porcupines, a capybara and of course the kitten halftime show — and that’s just during the regular Puppy Bowl. There’s also a “training camp” special, a separate Dog Bowl for adult dogs and a pregame show. None of this is particularly high-impact viewing, but dropping in for 10 or 20 minutes of fluff time never hurt anyone.‘The World’s Most Extraordinary Homes’When to watch: Now, on Netflix.A new batch of four episodes does what “Extraordinary” does best: It makes you wish you lived in a glamorous, unique house far away from all this, with a sturdy sexual companion and unshakable fiscal stability, letting your architect create a “conversation” with the landscape while your children develop their natural senses of adventure and artistry. Solo House 2, in Spain, is a standout, but all the houses are stunning. More important, they are hugely different from one another. The show doesn’t get old even if one’s profound real estate envy does.‘The ABC Murders’ When to watch: Starting Friday, on Amazon.John Malkovich is your new Hercule Poirot in this lavish three-part mini-series. At this point, there are a lot of terrific shows set in England in the 1930s, including mysteries, and they all look terrific and lavish — even during the scenes set in the cruddy part of town or in disreputable establishments. “The ABC Murders” sets itself apart with its sound design, so full and specific that even a loaf of bread has an audio component.
