AdvertisementSupported byThe victory over the Chiefs means Tom Brady and Co. will be playing for the title for the ninth time in the last two decades. By Bill Pennington and Benjamin HoffmanAs Tom Brady led the New England Patriots down the field in the crucible of overtime, there was a familiar sense of inevitability, an atmosphere that was both tense and predictable. These were only the latest minutes in a cavalcade of triumphant overtime postseason Patriots moments that stretch from a snowy game in 2002 to the one played in frigid conditions here Sunday night.More of Brady’s passes failed than succeeded in the overtime period against the Kansas City Chiefs, but all the ones that mattered most were reliably rifled into the arms of his receivers. As the Patriots neared the Chiefs’ goal line, a winning touchdown and a ninth Patriots Super Bowl appearance this century seemed preordained.When running back Rex Burkhead pushed into the end zone with the game-ending touchdown in the Patriots 37-31 victory, Brady began jumping up and down as he turned toward his team’s sideline.In the Patriots’ locker room a short while later, New England wide receiver Julian Edelman, who caught two overtime passes from Brady, said of his quarterback: “There’s no one I’d rather have in two-minute drill than No. 12. It’s in his DNA. He has a clutch gene.”Brady, meanwhile, focused elsewhere.“I’m so tired,” he said. “That was a hell of a game.”The Patriots have played in many such games. In almost every season this decade they stumbled enough that it appeared the long run at the highest level of success must surely be nearing its expiration date. And then there’s another game like Sunday when the Patriots, despite squandering a first half lead, nonetheless held off one of the most potent offenses in the N.F.L. to persevere and qualify for their third consecutive Super Bowl and fifth in the last eight years.New England will play the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII on Feb. 3 in Atlanta — which happens to be the 17th anniversary of New England’s Super Bowl victory over the Rams, who were then based in St. Louis.After a fourth quarter that featured five touchdowns from both teams, the Patriots received the football first in overtime. Brady twice pierced the Chiefs defense with dart-like throws on third down to Edelman to keep the drive alive. Soon the Patriots were at the Kansas City 30-yard line, but two Brady throws — one on a flea-flicker — fell incomplete.On third down, Brady rifled a pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski for 15 yards. Burkhead then carried the football on three successive plays, with the last ending the game.“Overtime, on the road against a great team — they had fight, they had no quit,” Brady said of the Chiefs in an interview with CBS after the game.The Patriots, who ran twice as many plays as the Chiefs did on Sunday, had taken a 24-21 lead late in the fourth quarter on a drive aided by a roughing-the-passer penalty and an 11-yard, one-handed reception by New England wide receiver Chris Hogan. On 4th-and-1 from Kansas City’s 10-yard line, Sony Michel, who had 113 rushing yards, burst through the middle, giving his team a lead with just 3 minutes and 32 seconds left to play.The Chiefs responded quickly, regaining the lead in five plays and less than 90 seconds when a pass interference penalty and a 38-yard pass to wide receiver Sammy Watkins led to a 2-yard touchdown run by Damien Williams.With just over two minutes to play, Brady got the ball and marched his team down the field, with Burkhead bulling into the end zone to put New England ahead, 31-28, with 39 seconds left in the game.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes coolly led the Chiefs back, going 48 yards in just two plays, and with 11 seconds remaining, Kansas City’s kicker, Harrison Butker, sent the game into overtime with a 39-yard field goal that tied the game, 31-31.Kansas City had trailed by 14-0 after the opening two quarters — the first time since Coach Andy Reid took over the team in 2013 that the Chiefs had failed to score in the first half — but the team came out for the third quarter invigorated, scoring a touchdown less than two minutes into the half.It was the Patriots who looked more energized amid frigid temperatures at first. New England opened the game with a 15-play, 80-yard masterpiece of precision and versatility, consistently confusing the Chiefs’ defense and keeping it backpedaling for more than eight consecutive minutes of playing time.The tone of the opening drive was set on the first New England play from scrimmage, when Michel sliced through a gaping hole in the middle of the Kansas City front line for an 11-yard gain.The Patriots stuck to the ground to convert on essential third down plays behind all-purpose running back James White.The Chiefs linebackers began sneaking toward the line of scrimmage, and Brady saw them, changing a play in a pre-snap read and throwing over the middle to Edelman for 14 yards.And so went the cat-and-mouse game, with White’s backfield mate Michel dashing for 11 yards to Kansas City’s 5-yard line. Three plays later, from the 1-yard line, behind crushing blocks by Gronkowski and fullback James Develin, Michel leapt into the end zone for a 7-0 New England lead.After the Chiefs lost six yards on their initial possession, the Patriots’ next drive, which began in Chiefs territory, was nearly as efficient.White plowed through holes in the Chiefs’ defense, and a well-timed shovel pass in the backfield to wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson gained 15 yards. Edelman caught another pass and soon the Patriots were a yard from the Kansas City goal line again. But on a third down, Brady faked a handoff, bent at the waist to hide the ball and popped up and lofted a quick pass toward the 6-foot-6 Gronkowski breaking across the middle.Brady did not see Chiefs linebacker Reggie Ragland standing in the path of his throw. Ragland made the interception and the Chiefs narrowly avoided falling behind by two touchdowns.But when the Chiefs went on offense, they continued to look out of sync and frustrated. The Patriots were successfully pressuring Mahomes, forcing him to flee the pocket and rush his throws.The Chiefs offense had only one first down near the midpoint of the second quarter when the Patriots appeared to have Mahomes corralled for a sack on a third down play. Mahomes instead slipped a tackle and fired a 12-pass to Watkins.On the next play, the Chiefs’ fastest player, Tyreek Hill, got behind his defender for a 42-yard reception. Suddenly, it was the Patriots defense that seemed to be unsteady, especially on the succeeding play when Williams, the Chiefs running back, was left uncovered as he ran a pass route into the New England end zone.In a costly mistake, Mahomes overthrew the wide open Williams. A sack of Mahomes eventually moved the Chiefs, who would gain just 32 yards offensively in the first half, out of field goal range.On their final possession of the second quarter, Brady connected with White on a 30-yard pass to bring the Patriots within striking distance of the Kansas City end zone. On a second-and-one, Brady pumped faked to his left to draw in Chiefs cornerback Steven Nelson as Patriots wide receiver Phillip Dorsett streaked down the sideline to haul in a 29-yard touchdown pass that gave the Patriots their 14-0 lead at intermission.[The Los Angeles Rams beat the New Orleans Saints, 26-20, in the N.F.C. championship game earlier Sunday, and will face the winner of this game in the Super Bowl. See how they did it here.]Here’s how the Patriots beat the Chiefs, by Benjamin Hoffman:Rex Burkhead surged in from two yards out to get the Patriots a 37-31 victory in overtime, before the Chiefs ever got a chance to possess the ball.Thirty nine seconds was plenty of time for Patrick Mahomes. The second-year quarterback took his team 48 yards on a pair of long passes, and while he wasn’t able to throw a touchdown pass on his third attempt, he had gotten his team close enough for Harrison Butker to tie things up with a 39-yard field goal.New England will have just 8 seconds and this game is almost undoubtedly headed to overtime.This game has lived up to expectations. Rex Burkhead blasted through the middle for a 4-yard touchdown run and the Patriots, who seemed all but done in this game, are now leading 31-28 with just 39 seconds remaining.New England went 65 yards on six plays and survived what appeared to be a Kansas City interception that was overturned as a result of a penalty.For Mahomes there is never a down or distance too far to rule him out, but he has a long way to go with almost no time to do it.Damien Williams raced up the middle for a 2-yard score, putting the Chiefs up by 28-24 with 2:03 left in the A.F.C. championship game.The Chiefs’ drive went 68 yards in five plays, and while it had many key moments for the Kansas City offense, it was far more about mistakes by the New England defense, and J.C. Jackson, a rookie defensive back, isn’t going to be very popular if the Patriots lose this game.Earlier in the drive, Travis Kelce had lost control the of the ball, and Dont’a Hightower had recovered, giving the Patriots the ball and the lead with just over 3 minutes remaining. A late flag came out, and a defensive holding penalty on Jackson had instead given Kansas City a first down.It was just two plays later that Jackson committed a brutal pass interference penalty that gave Kansas City 23 yards.Tom Brady now has two minutes, and the Patriots need a touchdown.Not content to let the Chiefs steal the game, New England marched 75 yards down the field, with Sony Michel barreling his way into the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown run. With the extra point, the Patriots are now back on top, 24-21 with 3:32 remaining in the game.Kansas City’s defense had tightened up considerably on its last few tries, but this time around they once again fell prey to a series of short grinding plays by the Patriots. On top of that, New England was able to take another 4:13 off the clock, extending its lead in time of possession to 37:35 to Kansas City’s 18:53.The drive was impressive overall, but on what is proving to be a rough day for officiating — especially in New Orleans — New England’s drive was extended by an extremely questionable roughing the passer penalty against Chris Jones. The play, in which Jones reached over Brady’s shoulder and tapped his shoulder, was ruled on by an official who was out of position to see what type of contact was made between Jones and Brady.The Chiefs have taken the lead.Given the ball in New England’s territory, Patrick Mahomes needed just two plays to put his team on top, 21-17, with a 23-yard catch-and-run to Damien Williams in which the running back took a floater of a pass from Mahomes and sprinted past the entire Patriots defense on his way into the end zone.Mahomes is up to three touchdown passes in the second half, and this time he capitalized on a Tom Brady mistake — the interception to Daniel Sorensen — to give his team its first lead.In a wild turn of events, the Chiefs lost a turnover thanks to a replay review, but then got the ball back thanks to an interception by Daniel Sorensen.It had briefly looked as if Kansas City had recovered a muffed punt. A lengthy replay review determined the ball never made contact with Julian Edelman’s hands, giving New England the ball at its own 28-yard line.The various replays appeared to show the ball clear Edelman’s hands, despite some odd movements in his thumbs.Considering the Chiefs had come up with a huge stop on 4th-and-inches on New England’s previous drive, the muffed punt was pushing the momentum of the game decidedly in Kansas City’s favor. While having to give the ball back had to be a blow to morale, Sorensen’s interception got the Chiefs right back into it.Patrick Mahomes threw four touchdown passes in the second half of the Chiefs’ loss to the Patriots in Week 6, and he’s already up to two in the second half of this game. His latest, a 1-yarder to Damien Williams, has Kansas City trailing New England, 17-14.The scoring drive went 75 yards on nine plays, with the biggest highlights coming on a 33-yard catch-and-run by Williams, and a brutal pass interference penalty in which New England’s J.C. Jackson mugged Travis Kelce in the end zone, setting the Chiefs up with a 1st-and-goal from New England’s 1-yard line.On top of those plays, Mahomes showed some toughness on the drive, stepping out of the way of a sack attempt and racing for a 9-yard gain, plowing into Patrick Chung at the end of the play, and then picking up a first down on a sneak up the middle.A few plays later, Mahomes saved the drive yet again with a sidearm throw to Sammy Watkins for a first down. The play after that was the huge run down the sideline by Williams in which the running back spun his way down the field past New England defenders.The touchdown seemed all but inevitable once the Chiefs reached the red zone, but the pass interference call against Jackson made it nice and easy for Mahomes to roll out and hit Williams with the short pass.The Patriots’ lead is up to 10 points after Stephen Gostkowski connected on a 47-yard field goal attempt.New England had to go just 8 yards to set up the score after having held tight against Kansas City’s offense with the Chiefs backed up inside their own 5 to start their previous drive. As a result, New England started the drive on the 50-yard line.The Chiefs’ defense acquitted itself fairly well on the latest scoring drive, holding tight on a 3rd-and-17, but thanks to the short field that didn’t matter.In what could be turning into a game of field position, the Patriots may have just given themselves a big advantage despite the teams having traded punts.Kansas City failed to do anything on its second possession of the second half, with Patrick Mahomes and his teammates going just 4 yards on five plays. But the drive had started at Kansas City’s 4-yard line thanks to a brutal sequence in which Tyreek Hill cost himself around 12 yards by running backward in hopes of finding a seam to exploit, and a blocking penalty tacking on another 3-yard loss.As a result, New England will be getting the ball at the 50-yard line, still up 14-7.Kansas City wasted no time getting on the scoreboard in the second half, needing just 2:04 to get a 12-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce. The Chiefs now trail, 14-7.Things started slowly, with Damien Williams picking up a combined 8 yards on a short reception and a short run. But Mahomes saw an opportunity to do some damage on third down, and he rolled out to his right before launching the ball downfield to Sammy Watkins for a 54-yard reception that caught the Patriots’ second sleeping.Clearly energized by the play, Mahomes threw aggressively to Kelce in the end zone, and as he has done so many times before, Kelce was able to control the ball in traffic and reward his quarterback’s faith.A mostly quiet first half ended with the Chiefs going out meekly, as Patrick Mahomes momentarily lost the ball on a strip-sack fumble before he recovered it and simply knelt on the ball to send his team to the locker room, down by 14-0.While the score is still relatively close, New England has dictated the tone of the game. The Patriots have exploited the Chiefs’ front-seven with a series of short passes and runs — not allowing Kansas City’s top pass-rushers any time to get to Tom Brady — and New England’s defense has mostly contained the Chiefs’ offense.That has resulted in a huge disparity in playing time, with New England’s offense holding the ball for 21:07 compared to 8:53 for the Chiefs.There was a brief glimpse of what Mahomes is capable of on two completions in the second quarter in which he was able to deal with the New England pass-rush and find his receivers deep downfield, but that drive produced nothing after a sack pushed Kansas City out of field goal range.Beyond those two throws, Mahomes’s passes have been off the mark, and Damien Williams has gotten nowhere with the running game. The Chiefs were outgained, 245 to 32, in total yardage.This year’s Chiefs scored the third-most points in N.F.L. history, so it is hard to declare them out of any game they play regardless of the score. But Kansas City Coach Andy Reid will need to heavily adjust his strategy on both sides of the ball if he wants to get back into the game.In the one small bit of good news for the Chiefs, they will receive the ball to start the second half.The second quarter had nearly ground to a halt thanks to a series of punts, but New England woke up in the final minute of the first half, with Tom Brady finding Phillip Dorsett for a 29-yard touchdown reception that, along with the extra point, has New England up, 14-0.The Patriots’ latest long drive went 90 yards on eight plays and has left Kansas City with just enough time to run one or two plays — or kneel on the ball — to end the half.The Chiefs’ defense, after failing a series of tests to start the game, came up huge on 3rd-and-goal, with Reggie Ragland intercepting Tom Brady’s pass attempt to Rob Gronkowski, thus stealing some momentum back for Kansas City.Up until that point, the Patriots had seemingly been doing anything they wanted, using runs and short passes to expose a front-seven that is good at rushing the passer but far worse at putting up with the quick hits that the Patriots can accomplish with their small wide receivers and their talented group of running backs.In all, the drive went 43 yards on 11 plays, but the Chiefs were able to escape, still trailing by 7-0.New England had gotten the ball back quickly thanks to a fairly inept first drive by the Chiefs’ offense in which Kansas City generated minus-6 yards as a result of a sack of Patrick Mahomes that came after he had his first two pass attempts of the game fall incomplete. The only positive movement of the drive for the Chiefs came thanks to a 5-yard run by Damien Williams — which he followed with a 2-yard loss — and a 5-yard penalty by the Patriots’ defense.Now Mahomes will get a second chance to show what he can do.It was clear coming in that this game would be a tough test for the Chiefs’ defense, and the unit looked almost helpless on an opening drive by the Patriots in which New England marched 80 yards on 15 plays, punching the ball into the end zone on a 1-yard run by Sony Michel.The seemingly endless drive chewed up 8 minutes 5 seconds of the first quarter and has Kansas City on its heels.The Patriots got off to a quick start on an 11-yard run by Michel, and proceeded down the field through a combination of short passes — Rob Gronkowski had two catches on the drive after having just one all game last week — and runs by their three-headed monster at running back (Michel, James White and Rex Burkhead).In all, Brady threw for 38 yards and the running game contributed 42.Advertisement
