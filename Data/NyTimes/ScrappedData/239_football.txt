Kingsbury’s arrival comes just days after the Cardinals cut ties with Steve Wilks, a defensive-minded coach who was fired after just one season.The Cardinals, who handed the starting job to the rookie quarterback Josh Rosen in Week 4, had a league-worst record of 3-13, and scored just 225 points, the least in the league.Kingsbury, who signed a four-year contract according to multiple news media reports, will be expected to replicate the success that Coach Sean McVay had with the Los Angeles Rams in a similar situation: a young offensive coach being paired with a promising young quarterback (for the Rams, that player was Jared Goff). The Cardinals’ announcement of Kingsbury’s hiring went as far as pointing out that Kingsbury and McVay are friends.As for Kingsbury, he made it clear that he knows what is expected of him, and that he believes he is a good fit with Rosen and the Cardinals.“With the offensive trends these days, it felt like perfect time to be here,” Kingsbury said in an interview with the Cardinals’ website.Kingsbury, who was fired by Texas Tech in November after a disappointing season, initially agreed to join Clay Helton’s staff at Southern California as offensive coordinator, but now he will try to continue the trend of bringing modern college offenses to the pro level. Kingsbury’s Red Raiders went just 35-40 over six seasons, but at its peak in 2015, Kingsbury’s offense averaged 45.1 points a game.The Cardinals were the first of eight teams with head coaching vacancies to officially fill the position, but the Green Bay Packers announced later Tuesday that they had hired Matt LaFleur in an apparent attempt at finding their own McVay-esque magic.LaFleur, who most recently was the offensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans, also served as McVay’s offensive coordinator in 2017 before joining the Titans in that role for 2018 — a move spurred by his desire to call his own plays. He was quarterbacks coach in Atlanta before joining the Rams.The 32-year-old McVay seemed excited for LaFleur but also amused, telling reporters on Tuesday when the move had been reported, “I’m too young to have a coaching tree.”For all the emphasis on young, offensive-minded coaches, older coaches with experience are not completely out of style. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers appear to be taking that strategy, announcing on Tuesday that they had hired Bruce Arians, the 66-year-old former coach of the Cardinals, as their new head coach.In December, the N.F.L. strengthened its rules requiring teams to interview minority candidates for top coaching and front office positions. The league’s commitment to hiring more minority coaches and executives is under renewed scrutiny because five of the eight coaches who were fired this season were black.All three of the expected new coaches — Kingsbury, LaFleur and Arians — are white.Five other teams — the Bengals, Broncos, Browns, Dolphins and Jets — remain in the market for a new head coach.Advertisement
