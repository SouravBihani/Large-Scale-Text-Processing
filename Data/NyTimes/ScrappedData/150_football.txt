AdvertisementtranscriptHosted by Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham. Produced by Neena Pathak.What does it mean for Nike to align itself with Colin Kaepernick?Thursday, January 17th, 2019wesley morrisI am not an opera-goer. I do not go to the opera— not on purpose, not for any sort of like artistic dance. It’s just an art form that I experience maybe once a year. And last year, I got taken to the opera by one of our colleagues— Anthony Tommasini— who does the opera criticism for the New York Times. And there is a little bit of preamble— you know, sit around and talk and you sort of watch everybody in their gowns and dresses come in and you look at people’s very expensive tuxedos. And you’re very aware that you’re about to have this rarefied experience.jenna worthamSounds luxurious.wesley morrisAnd at some point before the opera starts, everybody gets up and the national anthem starts. And then everybody starts singing the national anthem.jenna worthamHow weird.wesley morrisNow, to be fair, it’s the beginning of the New York Metropolitan opera’s season. So we’re seeing the first show. And the season kicks off apparently with the singing of the national anthem.jenna worthamLike a baseball game.wesley morrisLike a baseball game. Exactamundo.jenna worthamI mean, that’s so weird, OK.wesley morrisBut I’m kind of like— I don’t want to get up. I don’t want to do this here. So I didn’t. I stayed seated.jenna worthamGood for you.wesley morrisAnd I didn’t expect to do that. Now I’m in this sunken place, how do I get out?jenna worthamIt’s Get Out 4.wesley morrisSo I just sat there. And the longer I sat, the angrier I got.jenna worthamOf course.wesley morrisI’m sitting there thinking about black people and how they weren’t at the opera. But then there was this additional aspect of it which is I was now performing my patriotism.jenna worthamYeah.wesley morrisAnd I just didn’t want to participate in that performance surrounded by white people under those circumstances.jenna worthamHere’s what I’m wondering— did anybody else notice?wesley morrisI’m sure nobody noticed, but I felt very noticed. I went as the chief opera critic of the New York Times’ guest. And—jenna worthamOh, no.wesley morrisTo my left is Bret Stephens, the conservative columnist for this paper.jenna worthamAwkward.wesley morrisAnd I was trying to think what they were thinking in my not getting up. Like if they’d even noticed that I hadn’t. And I don’t know. I was like, are they going to think I’m like a Black Lives Matter person? And then I was like, well, I hope they do think I’m Black Lives Mattering right now.jenna worthamYes.wesley morrisAnd when I thought that, I was like, oh, I am staying seated. I’m not getting up.jenna worthamYou went full Rosa.wesley morrisNow I could never until that night have appreciated how long a non-Whitney Houston sung national anthem is.jenna worthamThat’s great. I mean, if Whitney had been singing it, you would’ve been standing.wesley morrisWell, yes, if Whitney had been singing it, my ass would have been up. But in remaining seated, I had a lot of time to think about why I didn’t stand up. Am I sitting as a form of actual political protest? Am I sitting as a form of meta protest? Is my protest a protest for protest’s sake, basically?jenna worthamRight. This is also just like only a Wesley monologue that’s like happening just for yourself in your head, but go on.wesley morrisFair. But then it led me to this other question— because I really felt like I was going to be asked to leave the Metropolitan Opera.jenna worthamThese days, the stakes are that high, though. That’s not a wild statement, you know what I mean? Like, this is the climate we’re living in. So what you’re basically telling me, Mr. Wesley Morris, is that you’re like the Colin Kaepernick of the opera. At least that’s how you felt in that moment.wesley morrisWow. OK. I would not say I was the Colin Kaepernick. But, listen, I did experience an affinity with him and I understood for the duration of that song some tiny part of what he and the other people who’ve carried on these protests of certain American values in his name feel yea when they sit during that song. It’s a long time when you feel like there is a risk to your remaining seated— or kneeling, as it were.jenna worthamNow I don’t watch sports. I don’t watch the ball foot. All I know about this man is he’s tall, he is fine, he’s biracial, he was adopted by white people, and he grew up in California. So I’mma a hand— I’m going to toss it to you.wesley morrisOK so Colin Kaepernick— he played for the University in Nevada and was drafted by the NFL in 2011. And didn’t really hit his stride as a starter until Alex Smith got injured on the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. And he became the starting quarterback. He had started basically no games and then became a star. He took the team to the Super Bowl in 2013.jenna worthamBig Willie style. He was a big deal.wesley morrisBig Willie style— you hear that, Colin Kaepernick?jenna worthamI had too much Diet Coke today, leave me alone.wesley morrisHe was a star. And it was one of those great sports stories where a person of whom little was expected and little was known winds up going to the Super Bowl. Now it’s also interesting to note that that Super Bowl in 2013 that was won by the Seattle Seahawks was the first to ever feature two black quarterbacks.jenna worthamIncredible.wesley morrisTwo biracial quarterbacks, by the way. But then— I don’t know— he got into a slump. The thing that was magical about him became somewhat ordinary and probably detrimental, which was his improvisation on the field.jenna worthamOK.wesley morrisSo at the start of 2016, Colin Kaepernick is basically fighting for his job. So at the same time that this man is competing to start for his football team, you have this really fraught national political environment.jenna worthamThat’s right.wesley morrisDonald Trump is running for president.jenna worthamAnd we’re in a moment too— let’s not forget in 2016— all of our feeds, all the newspapers, everything on television is reverberating with these two seemingly parallel, very close together, really horrific deaths at the hands of the police of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota.wesley morrisAnd those deaths come in the context of what seems like a constant flow of dead black people at the hands of the police.jenna worthamMany of whom— there are lots of questions about whether or not they’ll be charged. Most of them end up on paid leave. There is a feeling of unrest and injustice held by, I would say, probably every black person in the country at this moment in time.wesley morrisSo during this period, we get to August of 2016. The campaign is heating up. We know at this point that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president.jenna worthamYeah.wesley morrisAnd that Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president. And football season is about to start. They have these preseason games that really only if you care about your team are you watching.jenna worthamOK. so it’s not like prime time yet.wesley morrisThey’re on TV.jenna worthamBut it’s like the diehard fans.wesley morrisRight. So it’s not like these preseason games are big news. They’re like a warm up. They let you know how your team is probably going to do.jenna worthamA scrimmage.wesley morrisI’ll accept that.jenna worthamThank you.wesley morrisSo during one of these preseason games, a woman named Jennifer Lee Chan notices that something is off. She basically covers the 49ers for the team. She’s the team beat writer. And she tweets that something is off about this formation of the team during the national anthem. And it’s a wide shot of the whole team. And if you get your magnifying glass out, you’ll notice that somebody with Colin Kaepernick’s number on the back is seated.jenna worthamChillin on the bench.wesley morrisAnd what she says is this is not a Jeff Fisher-approved formation— #hardknocks. She’s referring to Jeff Fisher— the coach of a different team— whose team was the subject of a documentary series called Hard Knocks.jenna worthamOK.wesley morrisAnd Jeff Fisher’s whole thing is— you’ve got to stand for the national anthem. You’ve got to be grateful for what you got, because the NFL is giving it to you, negros.jenna worthamNow this is where I started to pay attention. No one had really noticed until this point. Now the sitting starts getting national attention. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]colin kaepernickI’ll continue to sit. I’m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. [END PLAYBACK]jenna worthamColin Kaepernick is asked about it directly in interviews. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]archived recordingSpecifically, what would you like to see change in order for you to stand?colin kaepernickThere is a lot of things that need to change. One specifically is police brutality. There’s people being murdered unjustly and not being held accountable. Cops are getting paid leave for killing people. That’s not right. That’s not right by anyone’s standards. [END PLAYBACK]jenna worthamSo it’s around this point in time that a man named Nate Boyer, who’s a veteran, he’s a former Seahawks player as well writes an open letter in support of Kaepernick’s right to protest. He says, “even though my initial reaction to your protest was one of anger, I’m trying to listen to what you’re saying and why you’re doing it. I look forward to the day when you’re inspired to once again stand during our national anthem.” Kaepernick hit him up, they meet up, and Boyer suggests kneeling as a compromise because he sees it as a sign of respect. He says, because people need to pray and we kneel in front of fallen brothers grave. So Kaepernick agrees. He starts kneeling during the lineup during the national anthem rather than sitting on the benches during the anthem itself. And that’s when everything changes.wesley morrisSo other players start kneeling and the concept of taking a knee goes viral. So Norman Lear, the great television producer, television creator, All in the Family, Sanford and Son, Good Times. He takes a knee, posts a photo of him taking a knee. And then says, as a combat vet, I fought Nazis in World War II. Today, I #takeaknee once more in solidarity with my brothers and sisters still fighting for equality and justice.jenna worthamYou get Tracee Ellis Ross, the entire cast of Grey’s Anatomy— Gillian Anderson, David Duchovny on the set of new X Files reboot. I mean, a lot of people are paying attention. What’s interesting about this moment is both the national attention, but also the protesting is now tangentially about police brutality. It’s really about defending Kaepernick’s right to protest entirely, which is a much easier thing to get behind if you’re famous.wesley morrisRight, yes. It’s much easier to hashtag—jenna worthamTake a knee than #StopKillingBlackPeople.wesley morrisRight.jenna worthamRight?wesley morrisAmen.jenna worthamIt starts to get a little bit more amorphous, it gets a little bit wobbly on the sides, because then you have Noz deciding to launch a line of Christmas apparel in support of prison reform. I mean, by the way, Noz’s sweater campaign is called “Kneeling Santa.” So this thing is getting way out of control in the best way possible.wesley morrisWell, let’s go to the worst way possible. Because the president— the current president at the time in 2017— gets involved— Donald Trump. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]president trumpWouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say, get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country. You have to stand proudly for the nation. So I watched Colin Kaepernick and I heard he’s terrible. And then it got bigger and bigger and started mushrooming. And, frankly, the NFL should have suspended him for one game and he would have never done it again. They could have been suspended for two games. And they could have suspended him if he did it a third time for the season. And you would never have had a problem. But I will tell you— you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem. You cannot do that. [END PLAYBACK]wesley morrisHe basically understands that he’s able to do this in some ways because anybody who has any passionate feelings for the NFL has, as a just a matter of marketing corollary, feelings for the American military.jenna worthamIn what ways?wesley morrisThe Department of Defense has spent millions of dollars trying to get these teams to recruit people— not the players—jenna worthamFascinating.wesley morrisBut the spectators— either the people at home or the people that go.jenna worthamYou can’t play football, but you can join the military.wesley morrisRight. they spent millions of dollars, mostly in the NFL, for more prominently displayed flags during the games, for actual recruitment either in the stadiums themselves or through advertising on television during games. They would stage these strange— in the context of the games they were strange. You’d have these halftime reunion specials basically—jenna worthamI remember this, yes.wesley morrisBetween troops that are just home from battle and their families during a football game.jenna worthamSo interesting.wesley morrisSo the degree to which the sport is conflated with what the military stands for is almost inextricable at this point.jenna worthamSo, basically, football games have become a pipeline for recruitment.wesley morrisYes.jenna worthamAnd advertising for the US military. Which, Mr. Morris, answers your question. Why does it feel so weird to sit during the national anthem? Because you can be accused of not being a patriot, and that’s the rhetoric that gets reinforced by what Trump says about what these protests mean.wesley morrisAnd so compounding these stress, I would say, around Colin Kaepernick’s protests is also the fact that he is unemployed. You know, by 2015, he was in a slump, he wasn’t playing well. And by 2016, he is talking about wanting to play for another team. So, in addition to fighting for his current job, he also wanted to leave open the possibility of playing somewhere else. And these protests were not helping.jenna worthamClearly.wesley morrisNobody— he’s now a hot potato and nobody wants to be caught with him in their hands.jenna worthamNobody has an oven mitt heatproof enough to handle this hot potato.wesley morrisYes.jenna worthamSo he’s out of a job. But, as we know, there’s about to be another big tectonic shift in the epic saga that is Kaepernick’s life. And we’re going to take a break and we’re going to talk about it when we come back. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]colin kaepernickIf people say your dreams are crazy, if they laugh at what you think you can do, good. Because calling a dream crazy is not an insult, it’s a compliment. [END PLAYBACK]jenna worthamIn the fall of 2018, this ad drops from Nike featuring Colin Kaepernick, along with a bunch of other very famous athletes— Serena Williams, LeBron James. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]colin kaepernickBelieve in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. [END PLAYBACK]jenna worthamBut Colin is the star. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]colin kaepernickSo don’t ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they’re crazy enough. [END PLAYBACK]wesley morrisYes, I mean, he’s narrating the whole thing over kids falling off of skateboards.jenna worthamAnd ambitious surfers.wesley morrisAnd paralympic athletes. It is a celebration of a triumph over various adversities.jenna worthamCorrect.wesley morrisAnd the establishment of Colin Kaepernick’s relationship with Nike.jenna worthamYes. But now at this point, Colin Kaepernick has been transformed into a folk hero and also a lightning rod, which, in turn, attracted the attention of companies who know what to do with that imagery. Into the fray steps Nike— a multi-billion dollar company both to illuminate him and potentially exploit him.wesley morrisYeah, I mean, to endorse the message while also possibly diluting the message.jenna worthamYeah.wesley morrisAnd, you know, this brings me back to the ad which, I have to say, is pretty mild given—jenna worthamIt needs some seasoning.wesley morrisIt needs some cayenne.jenna worthamThe holy trinity— it needs something.wesley morrisYes, it needs— some Lowry’s.jenna worthamLowry’s. No you did not.wesley morrisAnd I just feel like this was an opportunity for Nike to really step in to complete alignment with what it is Colin Kaepernick had initially been asking for with an ad that features things that we don’t want to see.jenna worthamThey actually could have believed in something even if it meant sacrificing everything.wesley morrisWell, I think you just put the nail on that one.jenna worthamOK, go on.wesley morrisBut the ad if it really— if the ad wanted to be crazy enough, would have just been a montage of the most horrible horribleness. Because—jenna worthamWow.wesley morrisBecause that’s what he is— that’s what the protest is.jenna worthamThat’s what he’s calling for to stop.wesley morrisThat’s what the kneeling was about. That’s what these other guys who are still in the league are kneeling for.jenna worthamRightwesley morrisThat’s what Black Lives Matter is protesting.jenna worthamThat’s what most black people in America want.wesley morrisYes.jenna worthamThe killing to stop.wesley morrisYes. And Nike has a long history of using causes and social activists as spokespeople to sell apparel. 1995 they had this ad featuring Rick Munoz who was an HIV-positive runner. And, of course, in ‘78, there was a Nike Liberator. I don’t know if it’s a shoe you ever wore, but the shoes were a thing. They’re still a thing. People wear them. You can pay a lot of money to get them on eBay now. So you had this history of this company being aware that there is a healthy relationship between its bottom line and the political objectives of certain social causes.jenna worthamRight. Nike sponsoring Colin is complicated. Because on one hand, it feels like this extraordinarily progressive thing. It feels very daring for Nike— like almost scandalous. Like, oh, my god, is Nike supporting Colin? Are they supporting Black Lives Matter protests? Are they are they coming out against police brutality? Actually, they’re not as far as we know. They’re simply saying, we support Colin Kaepernick as a political figure, as a social activist. But the campaign doesn’t really seem to have anything to do with his initial reasons for sitting down and then kneeling. And it’s also interesting, because a lot of people in my communities and in my circles and in my various feeds were applauding the Colin Kaepernick ads. They felt really seen by this corporate company, which I understand. I totally get it. And in some ways, I felt that way too. But I also feel very cynical about a giant, global company co-opting a social movement— which, essentially, they’re doing— that isn’t even about police brutality anymore. It’s just about the idea of what?wesley morrisOf Colin Kaepernick. We are so far from where we started in 2016. And this isn’t Colin Kaepernick’s fault. I think that the way things work now and the way he was attacked and ostracized by his employer, the industry in which his former employer worked— they basically have locked him out of getting a job. So the moral issues that you stand against when you stand with Colin Kaepernick include such things as police brutality and socioeconomic inequality, but also include getting this black man a job, standing up to President Trump, telling the racist in your town that he’s allowed to do whatever he wants as an American. If he wants to protest the national anthem, he should be able to. So it is not quite a grab bag, but there is a lot of things to protest when you stand with Colin Kaepernick. He’s become a symbol of so many things.jenna worthamAnd what does it mean when a company like Nike piggybacks on top of that symbol or they try to embody that symbol as a means to sell their products? Because, look, Nike’s stock went up 5%. That was a $6 billion— buh-buh-buh billion dollar increase in the company value after the campaign launched.wesley morrisWhat?jenna worthamAnd so you have to ask yourself a question— so who is benefiting more from this partnership, from this alliance? I feel like for me, all of my alarm bells start going off because I understand why the campaign excited a lot of people and why it felt really good to see Nike get behind Colin Kaepernick. But it also— I feel really skeptical because Nike is still under scrutiny for suspicious labor practices. There are all these anti-sweatshop protests happening against Nike because of their conduct in Vietnam where workers are claiming that they have to work really long hours and too hot conditions. I mean, the idea that somehow Nike is for whatever Colin Kaepernick’s for while still perpetuating some of the same types of oppressive practices— that even if he’s not directly speaking to, tangentially he is against the oppression of people of color— what does it mean to be parting with a company that might be participating in that at the same time?wesley morrisIt could be called Colin-washing.jenna worthamThat’s good.wesley morrisAnd to the degree that I am inclined to be cynical about this, it does involve the distance between what he meant to do in 2016 and what it means to stand up for black people, for oppressed people, for social inequality in a industrial land of plenty.jenna worthamWell, then you have at-home consumers who— whether or not they’re football fans or not— trying to figure out if burning Nikes is a protest or wearing Nike is a protest.wesley morrisYou have people actually destroying their Nike apparel to protest Nike.jenna worthamHashtag #justburnit. So you had people cutting off their swooshes, buying shoes and burning them— none of which damaged Nike’s bottom line whatsoever, we should say.wesley morrisBut I have to wonder— I have a reverse cynicism about this too. And it has everything to do with the shift of political power in this country over the last 20 years. Where what you and I want as constituents, as voters, as citizens matters increasingly less to the people who we put in office. In the last two years, you’ve had Congress people running from their constituents.jenna worthamYeah, like actually running from them.wesley morrisLiterally fleeing on foot, probably in a pair of Nikes, from their voters. So instead of governments— national, state, and local standing up for people, you now have these multinational corporations filling the void.jenna worthamThat said, though, I mean, is Nike protesting state policy if they’re just putting Colin Kaepernick’s face on a Billboard because my question is— and I’m still looking for the answer to this, but what does their balance sheet look like? Are they donating money to any of the causes that Colin cares about? Or does it count as a protest if these corporations are only shifting the needles in ways that benefit them as capitalist entities?wesley morrisWe are no longer individuals. We are constituents to these companies, because they own everything. They now are increasingly owning the government.jenna worthamRight, pretty much.wesley morrisYou can follow that money all the way to Washington because the corporate lobbies basically dictate policy. You know, we live in the United States of America, but we live also on Facebook. We live on Twitter. We live on Amazon.jenna worthamYeah, I mean, it’s interesting to think about even the president calling for his constituents that voted him into power to boycott Nike boosted the company’s returns.wesley morrisAlso, he did the same to the NFL, but the NFL went the opposite direction and made it really hard for those players to protest by basically putting their jobs on the line. So you do have this real tension where the only way to alter some of these policies is to find— when we’re talking about the president— is to find a mothra or a King Kong to go up against Donald Trump’s Godzilla.jenna worthamOf course.wesley morrisAnd Nike getting behind Colin Kaepernick— it is essentially giving him a platform that he would never have had as an unemployed football player.jenna worthamSo it’s beside the point whether or not Nike is behind the protest. The point is they’re imbuing, they’re amplifying, they’re putting halo around Colin that he, then, hopefully, in theory, then gets to— and I’m not saying whether or not this is good or bad. It’s just that this is sort of how it’s working that now he has this aura that he can spread around the causes that he cares about and hopefully affect some kind of change.wesley morrisYes, yes, yes. I mean, it’s, listen, I hate to say that it’s better than nothing, but it is kind of better than nothing.jenna worthamAnd, look, if your president is actively denouncing you, maybe it is strategic to align yourself with a giant like Nike who actually can take on the president. It becomes a question of multinationals versus nation-states. And maybe aligning with a problematic multinational is the lesser of two evils. It’s better than being out of a job and no one hearing what you have to say— although has Colin said anything lately?wesley morrisNo. That’s the other thing about this protest. It has become a silent protest. And that in and of itself is somewhat revolutionary. He doesn’t have to go on Wendy Williams to make his points. He doesn’t have to talk to Michael Strahan and Robin Roberts to make his points. We are simply wanting to know where the hell he is. And him popping up from time to time at the US Open, as one of GQ’s men of the year is in some ways satisfying enough. And he’s enough of an ambient presence to make the idea of standing against something and standing for something a real act in some ways— whether he talks about what he’s doing or not. He’s said his piece, what more could he say?jenna worthamColin Kaepernick, at least, has been pretty unwavering in his activism in a financial monetary way. He’s been donating a ton of money— over $1 million— to various charities since this whole thing began. So at least there is that.wesley morrisRight. And that in and of itself is a huge shift. Because he’s now in a position to do something that black celebrity activists had not previously been able to do.jenna worthamLike actually literally not been able to do because they were mostly broke, destitute, and shuffled out of this country.wesley morrisOr just chose to leave because it was too oppressive to stay. Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson basically wind up having— in fighting racism, wind up finding it more comfortable and safer to live abroad.jenna worthamYeah.wesley morrisAnd then you have two guys like Tommie Smith and John Carlos who, in raising their fists at the ‘68 Olympics in Mexico City, received international death threats.jenna worthamYeah.wesley morrisFor besmirching the Olympics with quote “politics” unquote, as though the Olympics weren’t in and of themselves an inherently political activity.jenna worthamIn this country, we have a long history of black people speaking up and losing everything. But now with the backing of Nike, you see Kaepernick more powerful than ever.wesley morrisYeah, I mean, he’s suing the NFL for collusion, basically, for keeping him out of the league. But I also think that he has awakened in the average person a sense of—jenna worthamSimilar agency, honestly, and similar validation or affirmation that they have a right to be angry too.wesley morrisOr not even angry, but just curious. Just curious. I’m thinking specifically about India Landry— a high school student who was expelled from her school when she refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance. And she sued the school last year. The suit is still ongoing— has not been resolved yet. But I do think that there is this sense that what harm comes of my not standing for the Pledge of Allegiance?jenna worthamWow.wesley morrisI don’t say that I’m not American, I just don’t know that I can pledge allegiance to a flag under which there are any number of things I have a problem with that my government either seems to perpetuate or neglect or ignore.jenna worthamRight. So, Wesley, what you’re illuminating for me is bigger than my initial cynicism about Nike— or it just puts it in a new perspective, which is Nike’s intentions are kind of irrelevant. Because what’s happened is something that can’t be put back in a box. So you’ve got India Landry feeling emboldened to exercise her right as an American to take a stand and to say, I’m not OK with this. I dissent. So I guess for me, I’m coming around to— I’m softening a little bit of my earlier critique and I’m raising this question. I don’t know that I want this to be what I define as progress at this moment in time, but this might be as good as it gets. And, more importantly, are we OK with it?wesley morrisJenna Wortham, you just asked me whether or not Nike’s sponsorship, co-opting, standing alongside in support of Colin Kaepernick— whether that is OK. And in as much as it has brought people to the brink of thinking about these issues that he’s protesting— or even what it means to align themselves or tolerate or think about some of the things that he is asking us to think about despite the sort of benign aspect of those advertisements— which, really, if they wanted to be— what’s the tagline? What’s the other tagline in that ad?jenna worthamI got to look it up. Hold on, hold on. At the very end of the ad, Colin Kaepernick shakes out his fro and says— and it gets exponentially bigger— it fills the screen. That doesn’t happen. But Colin Kaepernick says, “don’t ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they’re crazy enough.”wesley morrisNow I think I’m pretty OK with Nike’s sponsorship of Colin Kaepernick. As we’ve discussed, complicated. Complicated.jenna worthamI hear you, but I don’t buy Nikes now and I’m not going to because Colin’s on the face those billboards. Now someone did buy me a pair of Nike’s because I have a bad back and I do wear them sometimes. But I will not give them money. And it doesn’t diminish my love of Colin Kaepernick and the support or the support for BLM. It doesn’t. It’s just complicated.wesley morrisComplicated, but I’m mostly on board with it because I understand the sort of political necessity of it.jenna worthamOK, go on.wesley morrisSo as I’m sitting there at that opera, it occurs to me as I’m standing here talking to you now— I was at the opera watching Samson and Delilah. Which, if you don’t know—jenna worthamI don’t know. It’s been a while since I’ve held a Bible, so please refresh my memory.wesley morrisIt is simply the basic story of a woman and a man who meet and fell in love. She is powerful, he is powerful. She learns that the secret to his strength is in his hair— his long hair. So she cuts his hair.jenna worthamI’m sorry. I just— OK, go on.wesley morrisNobody said the Bible was the gospel truth, it’s the gospel.jenna worthamWait, wait— so what you’re saying is in this narrative, it’s possible that Colin Kaepernick is the—wesley morrisSamson.jenna worthamAnd Nike’s the—wesley morrisDelilah.jenna worthamSo, Colin, don’t let Nike give you a relaxer— stay afro strong, right?wesley morrisYes. Colin, you’ve got to keep that afro.jenna worthamKeep them cornrows. Keep them in.wesley morrisI think that there is a degree to which the fame and the spokesperson would run the risk of collapsing or completely taking over the protest element of what he’s trying to do.jenna worthamRight. It’s a cautionary tale. And it’s a cautionary tale not just for Colin Kaepernick, but really anyone who is at the risk of co-option or at the risk of being wielded by a corporation for their own consumer benefit under the guise of political or social activism. I mean, look— the relationship between Nike and Colin Kaepernick goes beyond this particular moment. Corporations are interested in capitalizing on black cool. They always have been and they’re willing to do it in any way that makes sense. And it’s happening on a scale as large as Nike to as small as influencers on Instagram. What Colin does sets a template for what other highly visible famous or slightly famous black people decide to do when companies reach out to them and want to promote them because of their alignment with social movement and social activism. It’s just a much bigger deal than just this moment in time. So maybe the question that we’re asking should be different. It’s not whether or not we’re OK with Nike’s sponsorship of Colin Kaepernick, it’s whether or not Colin Kaepernick can survive and whether or not the movement that Colin Kaepernick started can survive the sponsorship of Nike— because it has to.
