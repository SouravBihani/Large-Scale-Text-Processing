Canada’s government said that, in all, 14 Canadian employees, spouses and dependents have been affected.Global Affairs Canada, the nation’s foreign ministry, said that after the last confirmed case of unusual symptoms, in November 2018, Canadian staff members in Havana undertook additional medical testing. Those tests confirmed “an additional employee has symptoms consistent with those of previously affected employees,” the ministry’s statement said.Though the Canadian government had started “revised security measures,” it said, “we have decided to reduce by up to half the number of Canadian staff posted to Havana.”The Canadian Embassy will continue to function with consular services and an ambassador, the ministry said, but some programs may be affected. It did not respond to questions about current or future staffing numbers.There was no evidence that Canadian travelers are at risk, the ministry said.So far, 26 Americans have been affected with similar maladies, according to the State Department, and doctors who examined some of the Americans said they had suffered inner-ear damage.But neither the United States nor Canada has determined a cause for the symptoms, leading to speculation that some kind of microwave weapon may have been deployed against the diplomats, who have described hearing a strange, high-pitched sound, often accompanied by a sensation of intense pressure.Two scientists have also suggested that a species of loud, droning cricket may have been responsible for the noise, although its sounds are rapid-fire pulses while the diplomats described an erratic sound.The United States has also withdrawn personnel from its embassy in Havana, reducing its operations to a bare-bones staff of about two dozen. And in October 2017 the Trump administration expelled over a dozen Cuban diplomats over the illnesses, after issuing a warning to Americans not to travel to the island.Cuba has denied any responsibility for the illnesses, and condemned the expulsions of diplomats as a “hasty, inappropriate and unthinking” decision that was motivated by politics.While the Trump administration said those expulsions did not signal a change in policy toward Cuba, it has taken a more hostile stance to Havana than the Obama administration, which began normalizing relations with the old Cold War foe.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect date for the United States’ expulsion of Cuban diplomats. It was in October 2017, not October 2018.Advertisement
