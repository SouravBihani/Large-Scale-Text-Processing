And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.
